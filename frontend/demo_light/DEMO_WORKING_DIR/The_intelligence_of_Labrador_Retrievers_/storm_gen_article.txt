# History

The intelligence of Labrador Retrievers has a storied history that is intertwined with their development as a breed. Originating from the coastal regions of Newfoundland in Canada during the 18th century, the ancestors of today's Labradors were initially bred by local fishermen. These dogs, known as St. John's water dogs, were prized for their working ability, intelligence, and trainability.
By the early 19th century, the breed caught the attention of English nobles who were visiting Canada. Impressed by their performance, the nobles brought some of these dogs back to England where they were further refined and selectively bred to enhance their innate skills. The dogs were officially named "Labrador Retrievers" by the Earl of Malmesbury, who was instrumental in establishing their presence in England.
During this period, Labradors were used primarily for hunting and retrieving game. Their keen intelligence and ability to follow complex commands made them exceptionally valuable in the field. As their reputation grew, they were recognized by the Kennel Club in England in the early 1900s and subsequently gained popularity across Europe and North America.
Labrador Retrievers' intellectual capabilities continued to be harnessed in various roles beyond hunting. They became preferred choices for roles such as guide dogs for the visually impaired, search and rescue dogs, and detection dogs, showcasing their adaptability and trainability. Today, Labradors are widely regarded not only as exceptional working dogs but also as beloved family pets due to their intelligence and gentle temperament.
