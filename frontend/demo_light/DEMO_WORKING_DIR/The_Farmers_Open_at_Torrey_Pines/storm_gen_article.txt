# History and Evolution

The Farmers Insurance Open, originally known as the San Diego Open, began in 1952 and has undergone several transformations throughout its history[1]. The tournament found its permanent home at Torrey Pines Golf Course in 1968, when it was renamed the Andy Williams San Diego Open[1]. This shift marked the beginning of the event being staged on a municipal course, a unique feature that remains to this day[1].
The tournament is organized by the Century Club of San Diego and has become a staple of the PGA Tour's early-season calendar[2]. Over the years, it has grown in prestige, attracting a competitive field that includes major championship winners[3]. Notably, the Torrey Pines South Course, one of two courses used for the event, has been the venue for the U.S. Open Championships in both 2008 and 2021, further cementing its reputation as a challenging and iconic course[4].
In 2010, Farmers Insurance became the title sponsor, a partnership that significantly enhanced the tournament's profile[5]. However, this sponsorship is set to end in 2026, with Farmers Insurance announcing that it will not renew its contract beyond that year[6][7].
The event typically takes place in the last week of January, fitting into the PGA Tour's calendar-year-based schedule[8]. The format involves players competing on both the North and South Courses over the first 36 holes, before moving exclusively to the South Course for the final rounds[2]. This format not only tests the versatility of the golfers but also showcases the distinct characteristics of both courses, with the South Course being particularly renowned for its difficulty and scenic views[9].
Throughout its history, the Farmers Insurance Open has been more than just a golf tournament; it has been a significant event for the local community and a prominent feature of the PGA Tour, drawing fans and top-tier golfers to the picturesque Torrey Pines each year[10][11].

## South Course

The South Course is the more challenging of the two, known for its demanding layout featuring narrow fairways and strategically placed bunkers[12]. It is the longest course regularly played on the PGA Tour[13]. The South Course is also a notable venue for prestigious events, having hosted the U.S. Open Championships in 2008 and 2021[4]. Renovated and redesigned by Rees Jones in 2001 and 2019, it continues to pose a significant test for the world's best golfers[4].

# Tournament Format and Structure

The Farmers Insurance Open, held at the Torrey Pines Golf Course, features a unique tournament format that has been refined over the years.

The South Course is particularly known for its challenging layout, with narrow fairways, strategically placed bunkers, and being the longest course in the PGA Tour's regular events[13][12].
The tournament, founded in 1952, has been held at the Torrey Pines Golf Course, a 36-hole municipal facility in La Jolla, since 1968[2]. As of the 2017 tournament, this marked the 51st time the event was held at Torrey Pines, and it also marked the 8th year of Farmers Insurance sponsorship[5].
Both the North and South Courses at Torrey Pines have undergone significant renovations, with the South Course being redesigned by Rees Jones in 2001 and again in 2019, to maintain its status as a premier golfing venue[4].

The tournament concludes on the South Course, with the final round typically held on a Saturday, making it one of the few PGA Tour events with a Saturday finish instead of the traditional Sunday conclusion[17]. Tee times for the first and second rounds are scheduled for 9 a.m., and the projected cut line often varies depending on the scores and weather conditions affecting the play[18][19]. Weather plays a significant role in the tournament, with rain impacting the speed of the greens and the softness of the fairways, thereby altering the strategy and execution of the shots[20].

However, Farmers Insurance has announced that they will not renew their contract once it expires in 2026[6][7].
The sponsorship by Farmers Insurance has contributed to enhancing the event’s visibility and branding opportunities[11]. The partnership has helped the tournament attract top-tier talent and secure its position as a prominent stop on the PGA Tour, which has positive ripple effects on the local economy.
