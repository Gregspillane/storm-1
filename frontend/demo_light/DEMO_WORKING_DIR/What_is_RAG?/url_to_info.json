Retrieval-Augmented Language Models\n\nRAG is a sophisticated framework designed to enhance language models by coupling them with external retrieval systems, addressing limitations inherent in static, solely parameter-based language models. RAG integrates a dual-component architecture where a retriever dynamically searches a structured external corpus for relevant information based on the input query, and a generator LLM uses the retrieved content as context to generate accurate and contextually enriched responses [Gao et al., 2023, Mialon et al., 2023]. This setup mitigates common issues such as hallucinations and factual inaccuracies in language models by grounding generated text in real-world, verified information. In practice, RAG systems employ dense vector embeddings to ensure retrieval relevance, capturing semantic relationships within documents beyond mere keyword matching. The retrieved information is subsequently fed into the generator, allowing it to synthesize data with pre-existing knowledge for enhanced coherence and contextual accuracy.\n\nRAGs can employ two main types of retrieval mechanisms: dense and sparse [Mialon et al., 2023]. Sparse retrievers rely on bag-of-words representations, excelling at finding documents with high term overlap to the query, while dense retrievers utilize neural network embeddings to capture semantic similarities, enhancing the model's comprehension of related concepts. By appending retrieved documents directly to the model\u2019s context, these retrievers allow the language model to ground its responses in a broader context, thereby increasing accuracy and factual consistency across complex tasks.\n\nThe success of retrieval-augmented models in various domains has catalyzed interest in their application to more demanding reasoning tasks. A great representative of such tasks is the construction and verification of mathematical proofs, which requires solving problems step-by-step, and generating precise mathematical statements. Recent approaches, such as chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting [Lewkowycz et al., 2022] combined with retrieval, highlight the potential for retrieval-augmented models to provide sequential reasoning support.

(2022)]. This transformation process is complex, requiring the formal system to not only translate symbols accurately but also to grasp the semantic and logical nuances of mathematical language. The goal of autoformalization is to enable computers to autonomously produce valid formal statements from human-readable text, thereby reducing the time and expertise needed to encode informal statements manually into formal systems like Lean.\n\nLLMs can perform autoformalization by using Few-shot prompting.

Addressing issues such as requirement changes and compliance issues at this stage is essential to prevent their propagation and mitigate costly challenges later in the project (Verner et al., 2014; Pacheco et al., 2018; Roy et al., 2016). Specifically, software in regulated environments demands meticulous attention during the requirements specification phase to ensure adherence to stringent standards and regulatory frameworks, which, if overlooked, can lead to significant failures and project setbacks (Marques and Yelisetty, 2019).\n\nRecent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), have motivated researchers in requirements engineering to explore the potential of these tools in enhancing Software Requirement Specification (SRS) documents. Effective compliance checking in SRS documents plays a crucial role in mitigating many associated risks. Luitel et al. (2024) demonstrate how BERT, a Large Language Model, is employed to detect and address incomplete requirements by predicting missing terminology, thereby improving the overall completeness of SRS. In addition to enhancing completeness, LLMs have also shown promise in ensuring regulatory compliance. For instance, the study by Hassani et al. (2024) illustrates how Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) can be evaluated for compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a legal framework aimed at ensuring data privacy in the European Union, using advanced techniques powered by Large Language Models. Their work highlights how automating compliance checks can streamline the validation process, reducing manual efforts and improving accuracy in legal and regulatory adherence.\n\nHowever, LLMs face significant challenges when validating SRS, particularly in regulated environments such as finance and aerospace, where adherence to strict regulations is critical. These challenges include difficulties in maintaining context across extensive documents, which can result in incomplete or inaccurate analysis during requirement compliance checks. A potential solution is to provide the most relevant reference text, allowing for more precise validation of whether a requirement is being violated (Spoletini and Ferrari, 2024). Moreover, hallucination, where models generate factually incorrect yet plausible content, remains a critical issue, particularly when retrieval mechanisms are insufficient and reasoning capabilities fail. Additionally, scalability and performance constraints limit their effectiveness in large, complex projects, and inherent biases in LLMs can result in prioritizing common problems over more nuanced, domain-specific issues (Huang et al., 2023).\n\nIn this work, we propose an automated framework to address the challenges of validating SRS in regulated environments.

AI-driven question-answering (QA) systems can actively manage uncertainty in cybersecurity problem-solving, offering interactive, inquiry-based learning experiences. Large language models (LLMs) have gained prominence in AI-driven QA systems, offering advanced language understanding and user engagement. However, they face challenges like hallucinations and limited domain-specific knowledge, which reduce their reliability in educational settings. To address these challenges, we propose CyberRAG, an ontology-aware retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach for developing a reliable and safe QA system in cybersecurity education. CyberRAG employs a two-step approach: first, it augments the domain-specific knowledge by retrieving validated cybersecurity documents from a knowledge base to enhance the relevance and accuracy of the response. Second, it mitigates hallucinations and misuse by integrating a knowledge graph ontology to validate the final answer. Experiments on publicly available cybersecurity datasets show that CyberRAG delivers accurate, reliable responses aligned with domain knowledge, demonstrating the potential of AI tools to enhance education.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe use of AI in education has the potential to transform the way science and technology courses are taught. In scientific learning, students are expected to engage in problem-solving and exploration, yet traditional classroom methods often focus on the passive acquisition of established knowledge. This approach limits opportunities for students to experience the process of knowledge creation, leading to lower cognitive engagement. Cybersecurity is a problem-based learning domain where students must master complex tools, develop defense techniques, and uncover new threats, which necessitates a re-imagination of traditional education practices.\n\nPrior research highlights that managing uncertainty is a crucial component of the learning process, as students often struggle with acquiring new skills, applying diverse methodologies, and forming new understandings. Educators can effectively manage this uncertainty by increasing it through the introduction of authentic, ambiguous challenges to stimulate critical thinking, encouraging deeper exploration and problem-solving, and reducing it by identifying optimal solutions to help students integrate new insights with existing knowledge.\n\nAlthough the RAG approach helps reduce hallucinations and address domain knowledge issues to some extent, the reliability of LLM-generated answers remains a concern for achieving educational goals.

BACKGROUND\n\n### A. Retrieval-Augmented Language Models\n\nRAG is a sophisticated framework designed to enhance language models by coupling them with external retrieval systems, addressing limitations inherent in static, solely parameter-based language models. RAG integrates a dual-component architecture where a retriever dynamically searches a structured external corpus for relevant information based on the input query, and a generator LLM uses the retrieved content as context to generate accurate and contextually enriched responses [Gao et al., 2023, Mialon et al., 2023]. This setup mitigates common issues such as hallucinations and factual inaccuracies in language models by grounding generated text in real-world, verified information. In practice, RAG systems employ dense vector embeddings to ensure retrieval relevance, capturing semantic relationships within documents beyond mere keyword matching. The retrieved information is subsequently fed into the generator, allowing it to synthesize data with pre-existing knowledge for enhanced coherence and contextual accuracy.\n\nRAGs can employ two main types of retrieval mechanisms: dense and sparse [Mialon et al., 2023]. Sparse retrievers rely on bag-of-words representations, excelling at finding documents with high term overlap to the query, while dense retrievers utilize neural network embeddings to capture semantic similarities, enhancing the model's comprehension of related concepts. By appending retrieved documents directly to the model\u2019s context, these retrievers allow the language model to ground its responses in a broader context, thereby increasing accuracy and factual consistency across complex tasks.\n\nThe success of retrieval-augmented models in various domains has catalyzed interest in their application to more demanding reasoning tasks. A great representative of such tasks is the construction and verification of mathematical proofs, which requires solving problems step-by-step, and generating precise mathematical statements. Recent approaches, such as chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting [Lewkowycz et al., 2022] combined with retrieval, highlight the potential for retrieval-augmented models to provide sequential reasoning support. These models can generate reasoning paths interspersed with retrieval steps to guide complex problem-solving processes, such as multi-step question answering, enabling models to leverage external information dynamically at each reasoning stage.\n\n### B. Autoformalization\n\nAutoformalization is the process of translating informal mathematical expressions, typically written in natural language (NL) or standard mathematical notation, into formalized, machine-readable language that theorem provers and proof assistants (such as Lean) can interpret and verify [Wu et al. (2022)]. This transformation process is complex, requiring the formal system to not only translate symbols accurately but also to grasp the semantic and logical nuances of mathematical language. The goal of autoformalization is to enable computers to autonomously produce valid formal statements from human-readable text, thereby reducing the time and expertise needed to encode informal statements manually into formal systems like Lean.\n\nLLMs can perform autoformalization by using Few-shot prompting. Few-shot prompting is a strategy that provides LLMs with small sets of example pairs, illustrating how informal language maps to formalized statements. These examples help guide the model in recognizing the patterns and syntactic structures unique to formal mathematical language. The LLM can then apply this learned structure to new informal inputs, generating outputs that are syntactically and semantically aligned with formal systems\u2019 requirements. This approach leverages the model's capacity to generalize from limited examples, enabling it to interpret complex mathematical statements and produce formal representations accurately.\n\nThe formalization process requires the LLM to maintain logical coherence across multi-step arguments and correctly interpret mathematical abstractions\u2014tasks that are beyond the capabilities of many general-purpose language models. However, LLMs that are fine-tuned with carefully curated formalization examples show promising results, achieving increasingly accurate interpretations of informal mathematical language. This advancement has significant implications for fields such as formal verification and automated reasoning [Wu et al., 2022].\n\nThe recent advancements in autoformalization and automated theorem proving build upon foundational datasets and innovative training techniques to bridge the gap between NL and formal mathematical systems.

These features are akin to the small set of concepts a person might have in mind when reasoning about a situation. We refer to such features as Noun-Phrases, and our Noun-Phrase Dominance Model that predates the OpenAI and Anthropic studies posited that LLMs self-organize around such noun phrases during training [13].\n\n**Long Context RAG**\nRecently, LLMs have greatly increased their context window, allowing a very large amount of text to be sent along with the prompt. Before the advent of long-context language models, RAG was a key solution for overcoming the limitations of small context window sizes. Some researchers have examined if a sufficiently large context window could effectively replace RAG altogether. Databricks examined the effects of increased context size on various modern LLMs. The net result was that no LLM, regardless of the amount of data sent to it, was able to exceed greater than 80% accuracy on various QA benchmarks [6].\n\n**Faithfulness and Correctness**\nTwo terms that are important to understand as it relates to evaluating RAG and LLMs are Faithfulness and Correctness. Faithfulness evaluates whether the generated output accurately reflects the information contained in the retrieved documents [14]. A response is considered faithful if it does not introduce information that is absent from the retrieved sources, and adheres closely to the input data. This criterion measures how consistently the LLM response aligns with the retrieved content. A perfect faithfulness score means there is no \"hallucination\" caused by deviation from the content (such as by introducing new facts or interpretations). In other words, a faithful response directly reflects the content of the retrieved documents, with all statements fully supported by the retrieved data.\n\nCorrectness, on the other hand, assesses the factual accuracy of the output within a broader context [14]. A response is deemed correct if it aligns with established facts, even when those facts are not explicitly present in the retrieved documents. Correctness measures how well the generated answer matches verified external knowledge. For instance, a correct response is factually accurate based on real-world information, even if some of that information originates from the model\u2019s parametric knowledge rather than the retrieved (non-parametric) sources. Faithfulness ensures that the response stays true to the retrieved information, while correctness ensures that the response is factually accurate, regardless of its source.\n\n**Explanation of Acurai Terms**\nWe use the terms \"accurate\" and \"faithful\" herein interchangeably. For our primary use case (enterprise chatbots), the goal is to provide answers that are faithful to the information provided. For example, if an enterprise customer is a car company, they want their chatbot to be faithful to the documents provided to the chatbot, which may say their cars are \"the best\". This faithful answer may not be an objectively quantifiable answer; and perhaps even according to a third party, this company\u2019s cars are not, in fact, \"the best\". In many chatbots, correctness can be ambiguous or debatable, depending on the topic and question asked (\"Who is the greatest opera singer of all time?\"), whereas faithfulness can always be measured in concrete terms.\n\nIn a RAG-based chatbot, we refer to hallucinations as referring to any deviation from the provided context. Importantly, LLMs can still hallucinate even when clearly written facts are sent along with the query. For example, ChatGPT-3.5 Turbo was provided the following clearly written statements about calcium: \"Calcium is a sliver-grey metal. Calcium melts at 840\u00b0C. Calcium boils at 1484\u00b0C to produce monatomic gas. ...\" Remarkably, the LLM stated that all these properties belonged to magnesium when given the following instruction: \"Extract all facts about magnesium from the following passages.\" [15] The calcium statements could not be more clearly written.

These features are akin to the small set of concepts a person might have in mind when reasoning about a situation. We refer to such features as Noun-Phrases, and our Noun-Phrase Dominance Model that predates the OpenAI and Anthropic studies posited that LLMs self-organize around such noun phrases during training [13].\n\n**Long Context RAG**\nRecently, LLMs have greatly increased their context window, allowing a very large amount of text to be sent along with the prompt. Before the advent of long-context language models, RAG was a key solution for overcoming the limitations of small context window sizes. Some researchers have examined if a sufficiently large context window could effectively replace RAG altogether. Databricks examined the effects of increased context size on various modern LLMs. The net result was that no LLM, regardless of the amount of data sent to it, was able to exceed greater than 80% accuracy on various QA benchmarks [6].\n\n**Faithfulness and Correctness**\nTwo terms that are important to understand as it relates to evaluating RAG and LLMs are Faithfulness and Correctness. Faithfulness evaluates whether the generated output accurately reflects the information contained in the retrieved documents [14]. A response is considered faithful if it does not introduce information that is absent from the retrieved sources, and adheres closely to the input data. This criterion measures how consistently the LLM response aligns with the retrieved content. A perfect faithfulness score means there is no \"hallucination\" caused by deviation from the content (such as by introducing new facts or interpretations). In other words, a faithful response directly reflects the content of the retrieved documents, with all statements fully supported by the retrieved data.\n\nCorrectness, on the other hand, assesses the factual accuracy of the output within a broader context [14]. A response is deemed correct if it aligns with established facts, even when those facts are not explicitly present in the retrieved documents. Correctness measures how well the generated answer matches verified external knowledge. For instance, a correct response is factually accurate based on real-world information, even if some of that information originates from the model\u2019s parametric knowledge rather than the retrieved (non-parametric) sources. Faithfulness ensures that the response stays true to the retrieved information, while correctness ensures that the response is factually accurate, regardless of its source.\n\n**Explanation of Acurai Terms**\nWe use the terms \"accurate\" and \"faithful\" herein interchangeably. For our primary use case (enterprise chatbots), the goal is to provide answers that are faithful to the information provided. For example, if an enterprise customer is a car company, they want their chatbot to be faithful to the documents provided to the chatbot, which may say their cars are \"the best\". This faithful answer may not be an objectively quantifiable answer; and perhaps even according to a third party, this company\u2019s cars are not, in fact, \"the best\". In many chatbots, correctness can be ambiguous or debatable, depending on the topic and question asked (\"Who is the greatest opera singer of all time?\"), whereas faithfulness can always be measured in concrete terms.\n\nIn a RAG-based chatbot, we refer to hallucinations as referring to any deviation from the provided context. Importantly, LLMs can still hallucinate even when clearly written facts are sent along with the query. For example, ChatGPT-3.5 Turbo was provided the following clearly written statements about calcium: \"Calcium is a sliver-grey metal. Calcium melts at 840\u00b0C. Calcium boils at 1484\u00b0C to produce monatomic gas. ...\" Remarkably, the LLM stated that all these properties belonged to magnesium when given the following instruction: \"Extract all facts about magnesium from the following passages.\" [15] The calcium statements could not be more clearly written. The prompt also clearly asks about magnesium. Nevertheless, the LLM treated magnesium as if it is the same thing as calcium. Acurai\u2019s Noun-Phrase Dominance Model says that all hallucinations occur when the LLM mistakes two distinct Noun-Phrases as being the same thing. More specifically, the LLM does so when the distinct noun phrases are semantically similar, such as is the case with calcium and magnesium [16].", "tokenCount": 1156, "transformConfig": "{\"mode\":\"default\",\"options\":{\"auto_mode\":true,\"continuous_mode\":true}}", "hybridScore": "4.88261175"}, "citation_uuid": -1}, "4930b61d-8938-4f73-a8d6-7cf93ba3ab85": {"url": "4930b61d-8938-4f73-a8d6-7cf93ba3ab85", "description": "", "snippets": ["Document: 2412.05838v1.pdf\nType: application/pdf\nModified: 2024-12-24T20:28:56.762Z\nChunk: 1 of 16\n\n# A COLLABORATIVE MULTI-AGENT APPROACH TO RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION ACROSS DIVERSE DATA SOURCES\n\n**Aniruddha Salve**\niASYS Technology Solutions Pvt.

However, their utility in tasks requiring advanced reasoning, such as generating and evaluating mathematical statements and proofs, remains underexplored. This study explores the use of Lean, a programming language for writing mathematical proofs, to populate the knowledge corpus used by RAG systems. We hope for this to lay the foundation to exploring different methods of using RAGs to improve the performance of LLMs in advanced logical reasoning tasks.\n\n----\n\n## I. INTRODUCTION\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, but they still face significant challenges, particularly in generating accurate and reliable information. One of the key issues is their tendency to produce hallucinated or incorrect responses. This has led to the use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAGs) [Gao et al., 2023, Mialon et al., 2023] in an effort to overcome such challenges, since RAGs allow the models to rely on verified external sources of information, which can offer increased accuracy to the generated data and combat hallucinations. However, RAGs still fail to ground LLMs when generating solutions to logical questions, and LLMs still fall short when attempting tasks that require the use of general reasoning skills. This manifests especially when it comes to mathematical reasoning.\n\nOne key issue is the difficulty LLMs face in achieving semantic understanding and contextual reasoning in mathematical language, often leading to incorrect or incomplete formalization of mathematical concepts [Ying et al., 2024]. This gap arises because mathematical language requires a depth of concept comprehension that is challenging to encode in token-based LLM frameworks [Gao et al., 2024]. LLMs also struggle with long-term dependencies inherent in mathematical reasoning, as solutions to mathematical problems often rely on concepts and steps from earlier sections of a text [Lin et al., 2024]. Given the models' limited memory, they have difficulty establishing continuity across extended logical arguments. Precision is another area of difficulty, as the inherent ambiguity in natural language (NL) can lead LLMs to make unintended assumptions, which do not align with the rigor required by mathematical languages [Gao et al., 2024].\n\nMaintaining logical coherence across multiple logical steps is a further challenge; models often create disjointed or incoherent solutions, reflecting an inability to understand the sequence and relationships required in proofs [Ying et al., 2024]. Handling mathematical symbols and complex notations also poses issues since these elements are often misinterpreted by LLMs trained primarily on text rather than on specialized mathematical symbols [Agrawal et al., 2022]. Recursive processes present additional complexity, as they require models to handle multi-layered logical states and iterative reasoning, which LLM architectures are not well-suited to [Xin et al., 2024].\n\nThe study will investigate the use of formalized mathematical statements in Lean, to build a knowledge corpus for the use by RAGs. This approach involves translating NL queries into formal language (FL), in order to query and represent data, potentially improving the performance of LLMs in a math-focused question-and-answer (QnA) application. Additionally, we will evaluate this method against established benchmarks, such as the Mathematics Dataset developed by Google [Saxton et al., 2019], in order to gauge its effectiveness compared to traditional RAG configurations that represent and retrieve information in NL. This research aims to assess whether integrating FL in the RAG process can yield advantages over conventional NL-based approaches.", "tokenCount": 1026, "transformConfig": "{\"mode\":\"default\",\"options\":{\"auto_mode\":true,\"continuous_mode\":true}}", "hybridScore": "5.51238775"}, "citation_uuid": -1}}}
