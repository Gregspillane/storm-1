[{"perspective": "Charity Worker/Volunteer: Will provide insight into the history and current use of RAG in the context of student fundraising and charity shops, including RAG week activities.", "dlg_turns": [{"agent_utterance": "RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation, a method that combines the capabilities of generative models with retrieval mechanisms to enhance performance, particularly in generating responses based on external information. This approach leverages large language models (LLMs) alongside external data sources to improve the accuracy and relevance of generated content.\n\nThe concept of RAG has gained prominence in recent years, particularly as the demand for more contextually aware and reliable AI systems has increased. Its effectiveness is particularly evident in applications like autonomous driving and network optimization, where real-time, context-aware decision-making is crucial. For example, a recent study introduced a 6G AI agent that employs RAG in conjunction with the LangChain framework, demonstrating significant improvements in network reliability and performance across various scenarios (Source [1]).\n\nDespite its advancements, RAG is not without limitations. One major challenge is its lack of contextual awareness, which can lead to difficulties in retrieving and synthesizing relevant information, particularly when dealing with complex queries that require understanding interrelated entities (Source [1]). Experiments have shown that when important information is not located at the beginning or end of a retrieved document, RAG's performance can drop significantly (Source [1]). Additionally, RAG can retrieve irrelevant or partially relevant data, impacting the overall accuracy of the outputs it generates (Source [1]).\n\nTo address these limitations, a new variant known as GraphRAG has been proposed. This approach integrates RAG with knowledge graphs, allowing for a more structured and relational understanding of the data being processed. By utilizing a graph-structured database, GraphRAG enhances contextual understanding and retrieval methods, facilitating more effective responses to both specific and broad queries (Source [1]). The introduction of GraphRAG marks a notable evolution in retrieval-augmented methodologies, showing promise in improving the overall performance and contextuality of generative tasks (Source [1]).\n\nIn summary, RAG stands as a pivotal development in AI, reflecting an ongoing effort to enhance generative models with external data retrieval capabilities. Its evolution into more sophisticated forms like GraphRAG indicates a significant advancement in addressing previous limitations while improving contextual awareness and reliability in various applications.", "user_utterance": "Could you please explain what RAG stands for and give a brief overview of its history?", "search_queries": ["what does RAG stand for?", "history of RAG acronym", "RAG meaning and definition"], "search_results": [{"url": "45fdfb96-6610-4c65-bdea-7c705a8ce97e", "description": "", "snippets": ["Document: 2412.07189v1.pdf\nType: application/pdf\nModified: 2024-12-24T20:46:51.699Z\nChunk: 4 of 9\n\n# DRL-PPO Framework\n\n## Enhanced Reliability\nRAG has also shown its effectiveness in enhancing the reliability of networks. By enabling real-time, context-aware decision-making, RAG helps provide reliable information about the network environment. For example, the authors in [8] introduced a 6G AI agent based on the LangChain framework, incorporating RAG and GPT-4 Turbo. Its performance is assessed across three autonomous driving scenarios, demonstrating effectiveness in real-time road updates, network configuration for tailored requests, and D2D vehicle communication. Results confirm its ability to enhance network reliability and performance significantly.\n\n## RAG Limitations\nDespite RAG\u2019s advancements in enhancing generative model performance through retrieval, it has certain limitations:\n\n1. **Lack of Contextual Awareness**: RAG can struggle with capturing full contextual information, especially with interrelated entities across multiple document sections or crucial data embedded in the middle of text. Experiments in [9] show that when using GPT-3.5-Turbo for multi-document QA tasks, performance drops by over 20% if key information is positioned mid-context rather than at the beginning or end. This decline is more pronounced as the number of retrieved documents increases, highlighting RAG\u2019s limited contextual awareness. In the context of networking, this weakness in missing information located in the middle of the database can raise problems with inaccurate mapping of network information, such as the connection information among devices.\n\n2. **Incomplete Retrievals**: RAG may retrieve irrelevant or partially relevant data due to its lack of structured understanding of relationships between data points. As experiments in [10] demonstrate, irrelevant content within the same topic can significantly impact LLM performance, decreasing generation accuracy by over 10%. This issue underscores RAG\u2019s difficulty in consistently providing comprehensive and accurate outputs. In the context of network optimization, such inaccurate retrieval can provide significantly negative influences on the decision-making process.\n\n3. **Challenges with Complex Queries**: RAG has limitations when handling complex queries that require synthesizing information from multiple sources or summarizing large documents. For instance, multi-document summarization experiments in [11] show that models including T5, BART, and PEGASUS achieve low ROUGE-L scores (below 0.2) on complex summarization tasks, indicating difficulty in generating cohesive summaries across related content. In the context of networking, lacking the capability to handle complex queries and summarize information can result in difficulties in obtaining a comprehensive overview of the network environment.\n\n## GraphRAG: Take One Step Further\nDespite previous enhancements, RAG\u2019s effectiveness in query-focused abstractive summarization over entire corpora remains limited. To address this, GraphRAG combines the strengths of RAG and knowledge graphs, overcoming each framework\u2019s limitations while enhancing its advantages.\n\n1. **Database Structure**: GraphRAG builds upon RAG\u2019s core features, adding a graph-structured database where entities and relationships are extracted by LLMs. Flat text chunks are mapped to entities and relationships within the knowledge graph, with vector embeddings facilitating retrieval. Furthermore, entities are organized into topic-centered communities through clustering algorithms, enabling retrieval from varying levels of abstraction and providing multi-angled insights into the database. In network applications, for example, such database structure can be obtained through the extraction of the interconnections among network devices, with entities representing the devices and relationships (edges) representing the connections.\n\n2. **Enhanced Retrieval Methods**: GraphRAG supports two synergistic retrieval modes: Local Search and Global Search. For Local Search, this method retrieves entity-specific information by traversing the graph\u2019s nodes (entities) and edges (relationships), capturing complex interdependencies to respond effectively to specific queries. For Global Search, Community-based retrieval uses summaries of topic-centered communities to answer broader queries. For example, considering a knowledge graph representing the network environment, the retrieval starts from the queried devices in the knowledge graph, then moves along their connections, and finally incorporates the explored information to identify the internet information (e.g., channel information, interconnections) around the queried devices.\n\nThe key characteristics of GraphRAG can be summarized in Figure 2. As a validation of GraphRAG\u2019s advantages, experiments in [12] comparing GraphRAG and vanilla RAG on various generation tasks demonstrated that GraphRAG improves answer comprehensiveness, diversity, and empowerment by approximately 30%, producing more contextually helpful responses. In networking optimization, GraphRAG offers distinct advantages, including:\n\n- **Enhanced Contextual Understanding**: GraphRAG leverages the inherent relationships between entities in a knowledge graph, enabling a deeper and more accurate understanding of context. It is able to assess the relevance of retrieved documents based on their relationships and connections, leading to more contextually appropriate retrieval.

This includes determining whether the requirement conforms to or violates the reference text, supported by a clear rationale that highlights the key areas of alignment, inconsistencies, or conflicts. This step-by-step logical approach, encoded into the prompts, ensures a rigorous evaluation while maintaining clarity and focus on critical details.\n\n- **Tree-of-Thought Prompt:** ToT prompting applies a multi-agent reasoning framework to assess the alignment between a requirement and its reference text. The process begins with three independent agents breaking down the requirement and reference text into logical components: Purpose, Action, and Conditions/Constraints. Each agent provides an individual analysis, ensuring diverse perspectives without cross-influence. A final arbiter consolidates their outputs, selecting the most accurate and comprehensive breakdown.\n\nIn the second step, the agents analyze the consolidated breakdown to determine how well each component aligns, partially aligns, or conflicts between the requirement and the reference text. Each agent provides detailed reasoning for their evaluation, emphasizing different aspects of alignment. The arbiter then synthesizes these analyses, identifying the strongest reasoning to produce a consolidated evaluation for each component.\n\nIn the final step, the agents collectively assess whether the requirement overall \u201cConforms\u201d or \u201cViolates\u201d the reference text. Their evaluations consider all components\u2014Purpose Alignment, Action Consistency, and Conditions/Constraints Alignment\u2014and are supported by detailed rationales. The arbiter reviews the agents\u2019 assessments to produce a final decision, either adopting one perspective or synthesizing them for a balanced conclusion. This iterative, multi-agent approach ensures a robust and comprehensive evaluation of alignment and conformance.\n\n### 5 Evaluation\nIn this section, we begin by evaluating the search capabilities of Graph-RAG in comparison to the baseline RAG. Subsequently, we assess its reasoning ability to determine the alignment between the retrieved reference content and the given requirement.\n\nThis baseline RAG implementation combines dense retrieval with a generative language model to deliver context-aware answers (Lewis et al., 2020). It begins by embedding documents into dense vector representations using a pre-trained Sentence-Transformer model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2). These embeddings enable efficient retrieval of relevant content. When a query is input, the system computes its embedding and identifies the most similar documents from the indexed collection.

This includes determining whether the requirement conforms to or violates the reference text, supported by a clear rationale that highlights the key areas of alignment, inconsistencies, or conflicts. This step-by-step logical approach, encoded into the prompts, ensures a rigorous evaluation while maintaining clarity and focus on critical details.\n\n- **Tree-of-Thought Prompt:** ToT prompting applies a multi-agent reasoning framework to assess the alignment between a requirement and its reference text. The process begins with three independent agents breaking down the requirement and reference text into logical components: Purpose, Action, and Conditions/Constraints. Each agent provides an individual analysis, ensuring diverse perspectives without cross-influence. A final arbiter consolidates their outputs, selecting the most accurate and comprehensive breakdown.\n\nIn the second step, the agents analyze the consolidated breakdown to determine how well each component aligns, partially aligns, or conflicts between the requirement and the reference text. Each agent provides detailed reasoning for their evaluation, emphasizing different aspects of alignment. The arbiter then synthesizes these analyses, identifying the strongest reasoning to produce a consolidated evaluation for each component.\n\nIn the final step, the agents collectively assess whether the requirement overall \u201cConforms\u201d or \u201cViolates\u201d the reference text. Their evaluations consider all components\u2014Purpose Alignment, Action Consistency, and Conditions/Constraints Alignment\u2014and are supported by detailed rationales. The arbiter reviews the agents\u2019 assessments to produce a final decision, either adopting one perspective or synthesizing them for a balanced conclusion. This iterative, multi-agent approach ensures a robust and comprehensive evaluation of alignment and conformance.\n\n### 5 Evaluation\nIn this section, we begin by evaluating the search capabilities of Graph-RAG in comparison to the baseline RAG. Subsequently, we assess its reasoning ability to determine the alignment between the retrieved reference content and the given requirement.\n\nThis baseline RAG implementation combines dense retrieval with a generative language model to deliver context-aware answers (Lewis et al., 2020). It begins by embedding documents into dense vector representations using a pre-trained Sentence-Transformer model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2). These embeddings enable efficient retrieval of relevant content. When a query is input, the system computes its embedding and identifies the most similar documents from the indexed collection. The retrieved documents are then formatted into a prompt, providing context for the generative model (GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini) to answer the query. This approach ensures that responses are informed by the retrieved context, making it effective for tasks requiring direct access to relevant information.

LLMs serve as the foundation for query generation and response synthesis, but their token limits and processing capabilities significantly impact the system\u2019s efficiency and scalability. LLMs can be broadly categorized into two types: local models and API-based models. Both categories have unique advantages and challenges, making the decision highly dependent on factors such as data sensitivity, computational resources, and scalability requirements.\n\n### Local LLMs\n\nLocal LLMs, such as Mistral, Zephyr, and Llama, operate within an organization\u2019s infrastructure, providing complete control over sensitive or proprietary data. This makes them particularly suitable for industries like healthcare and finance, where data privacy and regulatory compliance are critical. Local deployment ensures that no sensitive data leaves the premises, mitigating risks associated with data breaches. However, these models require substantial computational resources, including high-performance GPUs, for efficient operation, which can increase the cost and complexity of deployment.\n\n### API-Based LLMs\n\nAPI-based LLMs, such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT models and Google\u2019s Gemini family, are hosted on cloud platforms and eliminate the need for maintaining extensive infrastructure. They are easy to integrate, benefit from continuous updates, and provide high scalability, making them ideal for applications requiring dynamic workloads. Despite these advantages, API-based models introduce concerns regarding data privacy, as sensitive information must be transmitted to external servers for processing. Additionally, their token-based pricing models can lead to unpredictable costs for applications with heavy usage.\n\n### Token Constraints\n\nToken constraints further influence the choice of LLMs in RAG systems. Both local and API-based models impose limits on the amount of data that can be processed in a single query, necessitating the use of efficient data chunking and retrieval techniques.\n\n#### Table 1: Comparison of Local and API-Based LLMs\n\n| Model Type      | LLM Provider | LLM Model          | Context Window                     |\n|------------------|--------------|--------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Local LLMs       | Mistral      | Mistral 7B        | 4096 - 16K (Sliding Windows)      |\n|                  | Huggingface  | Zephyr             | 8192                               |\n|                  | Microsoft    | Phi-2             | 2048                               |\n|                  | Meta         | Llama 3           | 8192                               |\n| API-Based LLMs   | OpenAI       | GPT-4             | 128,000                            |\n|                  | OpenAI       | GPT-4 Turbo       | 128,000                            |\n|                  | OpenAI       | GPT-3.5 Turbo     | 16,385                             |\n|                  | Google       | Gemini 1.5 Flash   | 1,048,576                          |\n|                  | Google       | Gemini 1.5 Pro     | 2,097,152                          |\n\nThe selection of an LLM for RAG systems depends on a balance of priorities. Local models are better suited for scenarios where data privacy and control are paramount, while API-based models excel in environments that demand scalability and ease of integration. Hybrid approaches that combine local processing for sensitive data with cloud-based solutions for less critical tasks represent a promising direction for future advancements.

LLMs serve as the foundation for query generation and response synthesis, but their token limits and processing capabilities significantly impact the system\u2019s efficiency and scalability. LLMs can be broadly categorized into two types: local models and API-based models. Both categories have unique advantages and challenges, making the decision highly dependent on factors such as data sensitivity, computational resources, and scalability requirements.\n\n### Local LLMs\n\nLocal LLMs, such as Mistral, Zephyr, and Llama, operate within an organization\u2019s infrastructure, providing complete control over sensitive or proprietary data. This makes them particularly suitable for industries like healthcare and finance, where data privacy and regulatory compliance are critical. Local deployment ensures that no sensitive data leaves the premises, mitigating risks associated with data breaches. However, these models require substantial computational resources, including high-performance GPUs, for efficient operation, which can increase the cost and complexity of deployment.\n\n### API-Based LLMs\n\nAPI-based LLMs, such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT models and Google\u2019s Gemini family, are hosted on cloud platforms and eliminate the need for maintaining extensive infrastructure. They are easy to integrate, benefit from continuous updates, and provide high scalability, making them ideal for applications requiring dynamic workloads. Despite these advantages, API-based models introduce concerns regarding data privacy, as sensitive information must be transmitted to external servers for processing. Additionally, their token-based pricing models can lead to unpredictable costs for applications with heavy usage.\n\n### Token Constraints\n\nToken constraints further influence the choice of LLMs in RAG systems. Both local and API-based models impose limits on the amount of data that can be processed in a single query, necessitating the use of efficient data chunking and retrieval techniques.\n\n#### Table 1: Comparison of Local and API-Based LLMs\n\n| Model Type      | LLM Provider | LLM Model          | Context Window                     |\n|------------------|--------------|--------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Local LLMs       | Mistral      | Mistral 7B        | 4096 - 16K (Sliding Windows)      |\n|                  | Huggingface  | Zephyr             | 8192                               |\n|                  | Microsoft    | Phi-2             | 2048                               |\n|                  | Meta         | Llama 3           | 8192                               |\n| API-Based LLMs   | OpenAI       | GPT-4             | 128,000                            |\n|                  | OpenAI       | GPT-4 Turbo       | 128,000                            |\n|                  | OpenAI       | GPT-3.5 Turbo     | 16,385                             |\n|                  | Google       | Gemini 1.5 Flash   | 1,048,576                          |\n|                  | Google       | Gemini 1.5 Pro     | 2,097,152                          |\n\nThe selection of an LLM for RAG systems depends on a balance of priorities. Local models are better suited for scenarios where data privacy and control are paramount, while API-based models excel in environments that demand scalability and ease of integration. Hybrid approaches that combine local processing for sensitive data with cloud-based solutions for less critical tasks represent a promising direction for future advancements. Such systems could offer the best of both worlds, enabling organizations to achieve a balance between privacy, performance, and cost-effectiveness in RAG systems.\n\n## 2.4 Prompt Engineering for Multi-Agent RAG Systems\n\nPrompt engineering is a crucial aspect of the Multi-Agent RAG System, as it directly influences the quality and accuracy of the generated queries.

These contributions represent the most frequent applications of LLMs to network management, aiming to reduce manual labor and risks of errors. The work proposed in this paper is complementary to these approaches as they may rely on RAG systems to retrieve network-specific information.\n\n## Application of RAG in Network Management\n\nThe application of RAG within network management has been less explored. RAGLog [16] introduces a novel method for detecting log anomalies using a combination of vector databases and LLMs. This approach allows for the detection of anomalies based on raw log data, adapting to various log sources without extensive preprocessing. While promising for its adaptability, RAGLog encounters challenges related to resource consumption and latency, which could limit its scalability in larger network data.\n\nTelco-RAG [17] targets the processing of 3GPP documents. A pipeline with query enhancement demonstrates improvements in the accuracy of LLMs when handling complex questions related to the telecommunication domain.\n\n## VectorRAG and GraphRAG Approaches\n\nMore generally, VectorRAG, the predominant approach in RAG systems, computes vector embeddings for fixed-size chunks and uses semantic similarity to retrieve information relevant to the input query. However, this method struggles with the nature of network data where domain-specific keywords have different meanings in their context.\n\nGraphRAG [9] is a more advanced approach that integrates KGs with text chunking and embedding. The LLM is used to extract entities and relationships and summarize communities detected in the KG, providing a more structured retrieval (also uses semantic similarity). Although GraphRAG is efficient in summarizing and reporting tasks (see Figure 1a), it falls short in delivering useful answers, particularly when the query includes specific values, such as names or types, that need to be matched exactly in the retrieval as reported in Figure 1b.\n\nHybridRAG [8] combines GraphRAG and VectorRAG. Although this hybrid approach enhances the accuracy and contextual relevance of responses, it inherits the limitations of its base approaches. Another approach uses entity-relationship extraction to create a KG capturing the important information of the source data. The KG is then searched like a database by translating the textual query into a database query [18]. While this allows for accurate retrieval, it can be impractical given the imperfect parsing obtained with LLMs; as shown in Figure 2 where we tested the accuracy of LLM-based configuration parsing against Batfish [2].\n\n## FastRAG: A New Approach\n\nTo address these limitations, FastRAG extracts entities and their properties from source data while mapping each entity to specific lines of the original text. This method enables accurate retrieval using a KG while allowing for text search to handle vague queries and compensate for imperfect entity extraction. Text search, unlike semantic similarity, matches text based on exact wording or structure [19]. Both KG and text searches are performed using GQL queries on a single KG implemented in a graph database. Unlike other methods, FastRAG avoids costly processing of all source data through LLMs by generating JSON schemas and Python code for data structuring and parsing. While demonstrated on logs and configuration data, this approach can be applied to other semi-structured data, such as playbooks and alarms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first RAG system to rely solely on code generation for data processing.\n\n## Example Queries and Responses\n\n```plaintext\n% python ~m graphrag query ~~root ~~method global \"list the interfaces of boza_rtr\"\n```\nCreating LLM client request...\n\n**SUCCESS: Global Search Response:**\n### Interfaces\nThe Boza_RTR router has several interfaces configured for various roles within the network. Below is a detailed list of these interfaces along with their configurations and roles:\n\n#### GigabitEthernet Interfaces\n1. **GigabitEthernet1/1**\n- **Mode**: Access\n- **VLAN**: 16\n- **Trunking VLAN**: 209\n- **Role**: This dual configuration indicates its role in both local network access and broader network segmentation.\n\n2. **GigabitEthernet1/2**\n- **Mode**: Trunk\n- **Allowed VLANs**: 1, facilitating communication across different network segments due to its extensive VLAN range.\n\n```plaintext\n% python ~m graphrag query ~-root method global \"What is the IP address of interface 'GigabitEthernet1/1'?\"\n```\nCreating LLM client request...\n\n**SUCCESS: Global Search Response:**\nI am sorry but I am unable to answer this question given the provided data.\n\n## Accuracy of LLM in Parsing Configuration Files\n\n!Figure 2: Accuracy of an LLM in parsing configuration files\n\n## FastRAG Design\n\nWe designed a hybrid approach for both information extraction and retrieval. Instead of using indiscriminate chunking or user-defined schema, our method relies on converting data into a simple automatically-generated JSON structure, while maintaining a link to the original data in a KG [20].

These contributions represent the most frequent applications of LLMs to network management, aiming to reduce manual labor and risks of errors. The work proposed in this paper is complementary to these approaches as they may rely on RAG systems to retrieve network-specific information.\n\n## Application of RAG in Network Management\n\nThe application of RAG within network management has been less explored. RAGLog [16] introduces a novel method for detecting log anomalies using a combination of vector databases and LLMs. This approach allows for the detection of anomalies based on raw log data, adapting to various log sources without extensive preprocessing. While promising for its adaptability, RAGLog encounters challenges related to resource consumption and latency, which could limit its scalability in larger network data.\n\nTelco-RAG [17] targets the processing of 3GPP documents. A pipeline with query enhancement demonstrates improvements in the accuracy of LLMs when handling complex questions related to the telecommunication domain.\n\n## VectorRAG and GraphRAG Approaches\n\nMore generally, VectorRAG, the predominant approach in RAG systems, computes vector embeddings for fixed-size chunks and uses semantic similarity to retrieve information relevant to the input query. However, this method struggles with the nature of network data where domain-specific keywords have different meanings in their context.\n\nGraphRAG [9] is a more advanced approach that integrates KGs with text chunking and embedding. The LLM is used to extract entities and relationships and summarize communities detected in the KG, providing a more structured retrieval (also uses semantic similarity). Although GraphRAG is efficient in summarizing and reporting tasks (see Figure 1a), it falls short in delivering useful answers, particularly when the query includes specific values, such as names or types, that need to be matched exactly in the retrieval as reported in Figure 1b.\n\nHybridRAG [8] combines GraphRAG and VectorRAG. Although this hybrid approach enhances the accuracy and contextual relevance of responses, it inherits the limitations of its base approaches. Another approach uses entity-relationship extraction to create a KG capturing the important information of the source data. The KG is then searched like a database by translating the textual query into a database query [18]. While this allows for accurate retrieval, it can be impractical given the imperfect parsing obtained with LLMs; as shown in Figure 2 where we tested the accuracy of LLM-based configuration parsing against Batfish [2].\n\n## FastRAG: A New Approach\n\nTo address these limitations, FastRAG extracts entities and their properties from source data while mapping each entity to specific lines of the original text. This method enables accurate retrieval using a KG while allowing for text search to handle vague queries and compensate for imperfect entity extraction. Text search, unlike semantic similarity, matches text based on exact wording or structure [19]. Both KG and text searches are performed using GQL queries on a single KG implemented in a graph database. Unlike other methods, FastRAG avoids costly processing of all source data through LLMs by generating JSON schemas and Python code for data structuring and parsing. While demonstrated on logs and configuration data, this approach can be applied to other semi-structured data, such as playbooks and alarms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first RAG system to rely solely on code generation for data processing.\n\n## Example Queries and Responses\n\n```plaintext\n% python ~m graphrag query ~~root ~~method global \"list the interfaces of boza_rtr\"\n```\nCreating LLM client request...\n\n**SUCCESS: Global Search Response:**\n### Interfaces\nThe Boza_RTR router has several interfaces configured for various roles within the network. Below is a detailed list of these interfaces along with their configurations and roles:\n\n#### GigabitEthernet Interfaces\n1. **GigabitEthernet1/1**\n- **Mode**: Access\n- **VLAN**: 16\n- **Trunking VLAN**: 209\n- **Role**: This dual configuration indicates its role in both local network access and broader network segmentation.\n\n2. **GigabitEthernet1/2**\n- **Mode**: Trunk\n- **Allowed VLANs**: 1, facilitating communication across different network segments due to its extensive VLAN range.\n\n```plaintext\n% python ~m graphrag query ~-root method global \"What is the IP address of interface 'GigabitEthernet1/1'?\"\n```\nCreating LLM client request...\n\n**SUCCESS: Global Search Response:**\nI am sorry but I am unable to answer this question given the provided data.\n\n## Accuracy of LLM in Parsing Configuration Files\n\n!Figure 2: Accuracy of an LLM in parsing configuration files\n\n## FastRAG Design\n\nWe designed a hybrid approach for both information extraction and retrieval. Instead of using indiscriminate chunking or user-defined schema, our method relies on converting data into a simple automatically-generated JSON structure, while maintaining a link to the original data in a KG [20]. The RAG further relies on LLMs to interact with the KG, utilizing GQL query generation to fetch and interpret information.\n\nGiven the extensive and continually updating nature of network data, minimizing processing time and cost is essential. To achieve this, we leverage prompt engineering findings which indicate that LLMs are more effective at generating code rather than directly extracting information into structured formats.

Unlike traditional LLMs, which rely solely on parametric memory, RAG introduces a non-parametric memory in the form of an external database or document index.

This method leverages the interconnected nature of data, representing entities and their relationships as a graph structure. By doing so, Graph-RAG improves the precision of retrieval by enabling contextualized exploration of related entities and concepts. This graph-based representation is particularly effective for tasks requiring fine-grained reasoning, such as cross-referencing, where requirements often reference interconnected standards, regulations, and supporting documentation.

Unlike traditional LLMs, which rely solely on parametric memory, RAG introduces a non-parametric memory in the form of an external database or document index. By retrieving relevant information during the generation process, RAG ensures that outputs are more accurate, contextually grounded, and up-to-date (Lewis et al., 2020).\n\nBuilding upon the RAG framework, Graph-RAG enhances retrieval capabilities by constructing a graph-based text index from external knowledge sources. This method leverages the interconnected nature of data, representing entities and their relationships as a graph structure. By doing so, Graph-RAG improves the precision of retrieval by enabling contextualized exploration of related entities and concepts. This graph-based representation is particularly effective for tasks requiring fine-grained reasoning, such as cross-referencing, where requirements often reference interconnected standards, regulations, and supporting documentation. Graph-RAG not only retrieves relevant content but also provides structured clusters of related entities, facilitating comprehensive cross-referencing and traceability analysis (Gao et al., 2023).\n\n**2.4 Prompt Engineering**\n\nPrompt engineering is the process of designing and refining input instructions, or \"prompts,\" to guide LLMs toward generating desired outputs. A well-crafted prompt provides context, instructions, and sometimes examples to elicit specific responses, improving the quality, relevance, and accuracy of the generated results (Marvin et al., 2024).\n\nChain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thought (ToT) are advanced prompting methods designed to enhance reasoning capabilities in LLMs. CoT prompting involves breaking down a problem into a sequence of intermediate reasoning steps, enabling the model to handle complex tasks like arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning. This step-by-step decomposition not only allows for better allocation of computation resources but also offers interpretability, as the reasoning process becomes transparent and debuggable (Wei et al., 2022).\n\nToT expands on CoT by framing problem-solving as a search process through a tree structure, where each node represents a partial solution and branches signify different reasoning paths.

Formal Language RAG\n\nThe FL RAG system incorporates formal mathematical language, specifically Lean code, into the retrieval process. This approach involves an additional step of translating the NL query into a formal representation before performing retrieval. When the user inputs a mathematical question in NL, the system first translates this query into a Lean formal statement. This translation is accomplished using a fine-tuned version of GPT-4o-mini, which was trained on a dataset [Ying et al., 2024] consisting of pairs of NL statements and their corresponding Lean formalizations.\n\nThe Lean-formatted query is then embedded using text-embeddings-ada-002 (we found text-embeddings-ada-002 to be capable of handling FL as well as text). Next, the query embedding is used to search within a vector database constructed from formal mathematical statements in Lean. This database was created by translating the same MATH dataset [Hendrycks et al., 2021], in order to ensure results aren\u2019t impacted by the knowledge corpus used.\n\nThe system retrieves the top k Lean documents that are semantically similar to the query. These retrieved documents are then combined with the original NL query to form the context for the language model. The combined context and query are input into the GPT-4o model, which generates an answer that incorporates formal reasoning. The system prompt for the model was the same as the one used in the NL RAG, which is \"Solve the following math problem. Give the final answer within {}. Like so: the final answer is {answer}\". The GPT-4o model is prompted with FL context. The generated answer is then presented to the user.\n\n```\nInput query\nGPT 4o-mini Query\nTranslation to LEAN\ntranslated query-\nvector              Relevant\nTranslatedQuery Embedding                         database              Documents-    GPT 40 Answer Generation\nsearch\nAnswer\nFormal Language RAG Flowchart\n```\n\n# C.

LLMs serve as the foundation for query generation and response synthesis, but their token limits and processing capabilities significantly impact the system\u2019s efficiency and scalability. LLMs can be broadly categorized into two types: local models and API-based models. Both categories have unique advantages and challenges, making the decision highly dependent on factors such as data sensitivity, computational resources, and scalability requirements.\n\n### Local LLMs\n\nLocal LLMs, such as Mistral, Zephyr, and Llama, operate within an organization\u2019s infrastructure, providing complete control over sensitive or proprietary data. This makes them particularly suitable for industries like healthcare and finance, where data privacy and regulatory compliance are critical. Local deployment ensures that no sensitive data leaves the premises, mitigating risks associated with data breaches. However, these models require substantial computational resources, including high-performance GPUs, for efficient operation, which can increase the cost and complexity of deployment.\n\n### API-Based LLMs\n\nAPI-based LLMs, such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT models and Google\u2019s Gemini family, are hosted on cloud platforms and eliminate the need for maintaining extensive infrastructure. They are easy to integrate, benefit from continuous updates, and provide high scalability, making them ideal for applications requiring dynamic workloads. Despite these advantages, API-based models introduce concerns regarding data privacy, as sensitive information must be transmitted to external servers for processing. Additionally, their token-based pricing models can lead to unpredictable costs for applications with heavy usage.\n\n### Token Constraints\n\nToken constraints further influence the choice of LLMs in RAG systems.

LLMs serve as the foundation for query generation and response synthesis, but their token limits and processing capabilities significantly impact the system\u2019s efficiency and scalability. LLMs can be broadly categorized into two types: local models and API-based models. Both categories have unique advantages and challenges, making the decision highly dependent on factors such as data sensitivity, computational resources, and scalability requirements.\n\n### Local LLMs\n\nLocal LLMs, such as Mistral, Zephyr, and Llama, operate within an organization\u2019s infrastructure, providing complete control over sensitive or proprietary data. This makes them particularly suitable for industries like healthcare and finance, where data privacy and regulatory compliance are critical. Local deployment ensures that no sensitive data leaves the premises, mitigating risks associated with data breaches. However, these models require substantial computational resources, including high-performance GPUs, for efficient operation, which can increase the cost and complexity of deployment.\n\n### API-Based LLMs\n\nAPI-based LLMs, such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT models and Google\u2019s Gemini family, are hosted on cloud platforms and eliminate the need for maintaining extensive infrastructure. They are easy to integrate, benefit from continuous updates, and provide high scalability, making them ideal for applications requiring dynamic workloads. Despite these advantages, API-based models introduce concerns regarding data privacy, as sensitive information must be transmitted to external servers for processing. Additionally, their token-based pricing models can lead to unpredictable costs for applications with heavy usage.\n\n### Token Constraints\n\nToken constraints further influence the choice of LLMs in RAG systems. Both local and API-based models impose limits on the amount of data that can be processed in a single query, necessitating the use of efficient data chunking and retrieval techniques.\n\n#### Table 1: Comparison of Local and API-Based LLMs\n\n| Model Type      | LLM Provider | LLM Model          | Context Window                     |\n|------------------|--------------|--------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Local LLMs       | Mistral      | Mistral 7B        | 4096 - 16K (Sliding Windows)      |\n|                  | Huggingface  | Zephyr             | 8192                               |\n|                  | Microsoft    | Phi-2             | 2048                               |\n|                  | Meta         | Llama 3           | 8192                               |\n| API-Based LLMs   | OpenAI       | GPT-4             | 128,000                            |\n|                  | OpenAI       | GPT-4 Turbo       | 128,000                            |\n|                  | OpenAI       | GPT-3.5 Turbo     | 16,385                             |\n|                  | Google       | Gemini 1.5 Flash   | 1,048,576                          |\n|                  | Google       | Gemini 1.5 Pro     | 2,097,152                          |\n\nThe selection of an LLM for RAG systems depends on a balance of priorities.

It addresses the limitations of traditional LLMs, such as weak reasoning and context handling, by using evidence-based reasoning to guide response generation. This approach simplifies the process by having a single agent retrieve and use relevant evidence for better output. The study shows that single-agent RAG systems can achieve strong performance in knowledge-intensive tasks, offering a more efficient alternative to multi-agent systems while still delivering high-quality results.\n\nThe Speculative RAG framework enhances single-agent RAG systems by using a two-LM approach for improved efficiency and accuracy. A smaller, distilled specialist LM drafts multiple responses from different document subsets, while a larger generalist LM verifies these drafts in a single pass. This method reduces token use, mitigates position bias, and speeds up processing. Extensive testing on benchmarks such as TriviaQA, MuSiQue, PubHealth, and ARC-Challenge shows that Speculative RAG boosts accuracy by up to 12.97% and cuts latency by 51% compared to conventional RAG systems, setting a new standard for single-agent RAG performance.\n\nAlthough pre-trained language models are good at storing knowledge, they have trouble updating and precisely accessing it, particularly when performing knowledge-intensive operations. To overcome this, RAG models integrate non-parametric memory, such as a vector index of Wikipedia, that is retrieved by a neural retriever with pre-trained parametric memory. This method enhances the model\u2019s capacity to produce precise and accurate answers. There are two primary RAG approaches: one modifies the retrieved passages per token, while the other uses the same passages throughout the output. Optimized RAG models have demonstrated improved generation quality and factual correctness on open-domain QA tasks, outperforming task-specific architectures and conventional parametric models.\n\n### 3.2 Multi-Agent Systems in AI\nBy focusing on relevant feedback and multi-agent communication patterns, this work examines how large language models (LLMs) might improve Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for technical support. Larger models outperform traditional approaches in determining relevance, according to experiments with LLMs such as GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, and Llama3. However, smaller models, such as Llama3, produced comparable findings when given appropriate prompts. Although they required more computing power, patterns like Reflection and Planning improved accuracy for multi-agent communication by 55% compared to simpler techniques. This study demonstrates how LLMs enhance RAG systems while balancing quality and efficiency.\n\nThe study also examines how to use Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance 6G communication systems while addressing limitations in logic, data protection, and refinement.

It addresses the limitations of traditional LLMs, such as weak reasoning and context handling, by using evidence-based reasoning to guide response generation. This approach simplifies the process by having a single agent retrieve and use relevant evidence for better output. The study shows that single-agent RAG systems can achieve strong performance in knowledge-intensive tasks, offering a more efficient alternative to multi-agent systems while still delivering high-quality results.\n\nThe Speculative RAG framework enhances single-agent RAG systems by using a two-LM approach for improved efficiency and accuracy. A smaller, distilled specialist LM drafts multiple responses from different document subsets, while a larger generalist LM verifies these drafts in a single pass. This method reduces token use, mitigates position bias, and speeds up processing. Extensive testing on benchmarks such as TriviaQA, MuSiQue, PubHealth, and ARC-Challenge shows that Speculative RAG boosts accuracy by up to 12.97% and cuts latency by 51% compared to conventional RAG systems, setting a new standard for single-agent RAG performance.\n\nAlthough pre-trained language models are good at storing knowledge, they have trouble updating and precisely accessing it, particularly when performing knowledge-intensive operations. To overcome this, RAG models integrate non-parametric memory, such as a vector index of Wikipedia, that is retrieved by a neural retriever with pre-trained parametric memory. This method enhances the model\u2019s capacity to produce precise and accurate answers. There are two primary RAG approaches: one modifies the retrieved passages per token, while the other uses the same passages throughout the output. Optimized RAG models have demonstrated improved generation quality and factual correctness on open-domain QA tasks, outperforming task-specific architectures and conventional parametric models.\n\n### 3.2 Multi-Agent Systems in AI\nBy focusing on relevant feedback and multi-agent communication patterns, this work examines how large language models (LLMs) might improve Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for technical support. Larger models outperform traditional approaches in determining relevance, according to experiments with LLMs such as GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, and Llama3. However, smaller models, such as Llama3, produced comparable findings when given appropriate prompts. Although they required more computing power, patterns like Reflection and Planning improved accuracy for multi-agent communication by 55% compared to simpler techniques. This study demonstrates how LLMs enhance RAG systems while balancing quality and efficiency.\n\nThe study also examines how to use Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance 6G communication systems while addressing limitations in logic, data protection, and refinement.

BACKGROUND\n\n### A. Retrieval-Augmented Language Models\n\nRAG is a sophisticated framework designed to enhance language models by coupling them with external retrieval systems, addressing limitations inherent in static, solely parameter-based language models. RAG integrates a dual-component architecture where a retriever dynamically searches a structured external corpus for relevant information based on the input query, and a generator LLM uses the retrieved content as context to generate accurate and contextually enriched responses [Gao et al., 2023, Mialon et al., 2023]. This setup mitigates common issues such as hallucinations and factual inaccuracies in language models by grounding generated text in real-world, verified information. In practice, RAG systems employ dense vector embeddings to ensure retrieval relevance, capturing semantic relationships within documents beyond mere keyword matching. The retrieved information is subsequently fed into the generator, allowing it to synthesize data with pre-existing knowledge for enhanced coherence and contextual accuracy.\n\nRAGs can employ two main types of retrieval mechanisms: dense and sparse [Mialon et al., 2023]. Sparse retrievers rely on bag-of-words representations, excelling at finding documents with high term overlap to the query, while dense retrievers utilize neural network embeddings to capture semantic similarities, enhancing the model's comprehension of related concepts. By appending retrieved documents directly to the model\u2019s context, these retrievers allow the language model to ground its responses in a broader context, thereby increasing accuracy and factual consistency across complex tasks.\n\nThe success of retrieval-augmented models in various domains has catalyzed interest in their application to more demanding reasoning tasks. A great representative of such tasks is the construction and verification of mathematical proofs, which requires solving problems step-by-step, and generating precise mathematical statements. Recent approaches, such as chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting [Lewkowycz et al., 2022] combined with retrieval, highlight the potential for retrieval-augmented models to provide sequential reasoning support. These models can generate reasoning paths interspersed with retrieval steps to guide complex problem-solving processes, such as multi-step question answering, enabling models to leverage external information dynamically at each reasoning stage.\n\n### B. Autoformalization\n\nAutoformalization is the process of translating informal mathematical expressions, typically written in natural language (NL) or standard mathematical notation, into formalized, machine-readable language that theorem provers and proof assistants (such as Lean) can interpret and verify [Wu et al. (2022)]. This transformation process is complex, requiring the formal system to not only translate symbols accurately but also to grasp the semantic and logical nuances of mathematical language. The goal of autoformalization is to enable computers to autonomously produce valid formal statements from human-readable text, thereby reducing the time and expertise needed to encode informal statements manually into formal systems like Lean.\n\nLLMs can perform autoformalization by using Few-shot prompting. Few-shot prompting is a strategy that provides LLMs with small sets of example pairs, illustrating how informal language maps to formalized statements. These examples help guide the model in recognizing the patterns and syntactic structures unique to formal mathematical language. The LLM can then apply this learned structure to new informal inputs, generating outputs that are syntactically and semantically aligned with formal systems\u2019 requirements. This approach leverages the model's capacity to generalize from limited examples, enabling it to interpret complex mathematical statements and produce formal representations accurately.\n\nThe formalization process requires the LLM to maintain logical coherence across multi-step arguments and correctly interpret mathematical abstractions\u2014tasks that are beyond the capabilities of many general-purpose language models. However, LLMs that are fine-tuned with carefully curated formalization examples show promising results, achieving increasingly accurate interpretations of informal mathematical language. This advancement has significant implications for fields such as formal verification and automated reasoning [Wu et al., 2022].\n\nThe recent advancements in autoformalization and automated theorem proving build upon foundational datasets and innovative training techniques to bridge the gap between NL and formal mathematical systems.

BACKGROUND\n\n### A. Retrieval-Augmented Language Models\n\nRAG is a sophisticated framework designed to enhance language models by coupling them with external retrieval systems, addressing limitations inherent in static, solely parameter-based language models. RAG integrates a dual-component architecture where a retriever dynamically searches a structured external corpus for relevant information based on the input query, and a generator LLM uses the retrieved content as context to generate accurate and contextually enriched responses [Gao et al., 2023, Mialon et al., 2023]. This setup mitigates common issues such as hallucinations and factual inaccuracies in language models by grounding generated text in real-world, verified information. In practice, RAG systems employ dense vector embeddings to ensure retrieval relevance, capturing semantic relationships within documents beyond mere keyword matching. The retrieved information is subsequently fed into the generator, allowing it to synthesize data with pre-existing knowledge for enhanced coherence and contextual accuracy.\n\nRAGs can employ two main types of retrieval mechanisms: dense and sparse [Mialon et al., 2023]. Sparse retrievers rely on bag-of-words representations, excelling at finding documents with high term overlap to the query, while dense retrievers utilize neural network embeddings to capture semantic similarities, enhancing the model's comprehension of related concepts. By appending retrieved documents directly to the model\u2019s context, these retrievers allow the language model to ground its responses in a broader context, thereby increasing accuracy and factual consistency across complex tasks.\n\nThe success of retrieval-augmented models in various domains has catalyzed interest in their application to more demanding reasoning tasks. A great representative of such tasks is the construction and verification of mathematical proofs, which requires solving problems step-by-step, and generating precise mathematical statements. Recent approaches, such as chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting [Lewkowycz et al., 2022] combined with retrieval, highlight the potential for retrieval-augmented models to provide sequential reasoning support. These models can generate reasoning paths interspersed with retrieval steps to guide complex problem-solving processes, such as multi-step question answering, enabling models to leverage external information dynamically at each reasoning stage.\n\n### B. Autoformalization\n\nAutoformalization is the process of translating informal mathematical expressions, typically written in natural language (NL) or standard mathematical notation, into formalized, machine-readable language that theorem provers and proof assistants (such as Lean) can interpret and verify [Wu et al. (2022)]. This transformation process is complex, requiring the formal system to not only translate symbols accurately but also to grasp the semantic and logical nuances of mathematical language. The goal of autoformalization is to enable computers to autonomously produce valid formal statements from human-readable text, thereby reducing the time and expertise needed to encode informal statements manually into formal systems like Lean.\n\nLLMs can perform autoformalization by using Few-shot prompting. Few-shot prompting is a strategy that provides LLMs with small sets of example pairs, illustrating how informal language maps to formalized statements.

It addresses the limitations of traditional LLMs, such as weak reasoning and context handling, by using evidence-based reasoning to guide response generation. This approach simplifies the process by having a single agent retrieve and use relevant evidence for better output. The study shows that single-agent RAG systems can achieve strong performance in knowledge-intensive tasks, offering a more efficient alternative to multi-agent systems while still delivering high-quality results.\n\nThe Speculative RAG framework enhances single-agent RAG systems by using a two-LM approach for improved efficiency and accuracy. A smaller, distilled specialist LM drafts multiple responses from different document subsets, while a larger generalist LM verifies these drafts in a single pass. This method reduces token use, mitigates position bias, and speeds up processing.

BACKGROUND\n\n### A. Retrieval-Augmented Language Models\n\nRAG is a sophisticated framework designed to enhance language models by coupling them with external retrieval systems, addressing limitations inherent in static, solely parameter-based language models. RAG integrates a dual-component architecture where a retriever dynamically searches a structured external corpus for relevant information based on the input query, and a generator LLM uses the retrieved content as context to generate accurate and contextually enriched responses [Gao et al., 2023, Mialon et al., 2023]. This setup mitigates common issues such as hallucinations and factual inaccuracies in language models by grounding generated text in real-world, verified information. In practice, RAG systems employ dense vector embeddings to ensure retrieval relevance, capturing semantic relationships within documents beyond mere keyword matching. The retrieved information is subsequently fed into the generator, allowing it to synthesize data with pre-existing knowledge for enhanced coherence and contextual accuracy.\n\nRAGs can employ two main types of retrieval mechanisms: dense and sparse [Mialon et al., 2023]. Sparse retrievers rely on bag-of-words representations, excelling at finding documents with high term overlap to the query, while dense retrievers utilize neural network embeddings to capture semantic similarities, enhancing the model's comprehension of related concepts. By appending retrieved documents directly to the model\u2019s context, these retrievers allow the language model to ground its responses in a broader context, thereby increasing accuracy and factual consistency across complex tasks.\n\nThe success of retrieval-augmented models in various domains has catalyzed interest in their application to more demanding reasoning tasks. A great representative of such tasks is the construction and verification of mathematical proofs, which requires solving problems step-by-step, and generating precise mathematical statements. Recent approaches, such as chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting [Lewkowycz et al., 2022] combined with retrieval, highlight the potential for retrieval-augmented models to provide sequential reasoning support. These models can generate reasoning paths interspersed with retrieval steps to guide complex problem-solving processes, such as multi-step question answering, enabling models to leverage external information dynamically at each reasoning stage.\n\n### B. Autoformalization\n\nAutoformalization is the process of translating informal mathematical expressions, typically written in natural language (NL) or standard mathematical notation, into formalized, machine-readable language that theorem provers and proof assistants (such as Lean) can interpret and verify [Wu et al. (2022)]. This transformation process is complex, requiring the formal system to not only translate symbols accurately but also to grasp the semantic and logical nuances of mathematical language. The goal of autoformalization is to enable computers to autonomously produce valid formal statements from human-readable text, thereby reducing the time and expertise needed to encode informal statements manually into formal systems like Lean.\n\nLLMs can perform autoformalization by using Few-shot prompting. Few-shot prompting is a strategy that provides LLMs with small sets of example pairs, illustrating how informal language maps to formalized statements. These examples help guide the model in recognizing the patterns and syntactic structures unique to formal mathematical language. The LLM can then apply this learned structure to new informal inputs, generating outputs that are syntactically and semantically aligned with formal systems\u2019 requirements. This approach leverages the model's capacity to generalize from limited examples, enabling it to interpret complex mathematical statements and produce formal representations accurately.\n\nThe formalization process requires the LLM to maintain logical coherence across multi-step arguments and correctly interpret mathematical abstractions\u2014tasks that are beyond the capabilities of many general-purpose language models. However, LLMs that are fine-tuned with carefully curated formalization examples show promising results, achieving increasingly accurate interpretations of informal mathematical language. This advancement has significant implications for fields such as formal verification and automated reasoning [Wu et al., 2022].\n\nThe recent advancements in autoformalization and automated theorem proving build upon foundational datasets and innovative training techniques to bridge the gap between NL and formal mathematical systems.

LLMs serve as the foundation for query generation and response synthesis, but their token limits and processing capabilities significantly impact the system\u2019s efficiency and scalability. LLMs can be broadly categorized into two types: local models and API-based models. Both categories have unique advantages and challenges, making the decision highly dependent on factors such as data sensitivity, computational resources, and scalability requirements.\n\n### Local LLMs\n\nLocal LLMs, such as Mistral, Zephyr, and Llama, operate within an organization\u2019s infrastructure, providing complete control over sensitive or proprietary data. This makes them particularly suitable for industries like healthcare and finance, where data privacy and regulatory compliance are critical.

They are easy to integrate, benefit from continuous updates, and provide high scalability, making them ideal for applications requiring dynamic workloads. Despite these advantages, API-based models introduce concerns regarding data privacy, as sensitive information must be transmitted to external servers for processing. Additionally, their token-based pricing models can lead to unpredictable costs for applications with heavy usage.\n\n### Token Constraints\n\nToken constraints further influence the choice of LLMs in RAG systems.

LLMs serve as the foundation for query generation and response synthesis, but their token limits and processing capabilities significantly impact the system\u2019s efficiency and scalability. LLMs can be broadly categorized into two types: local models and API-based models. Both categories have unique advantages and challenges, making the decision highly dependent on factors such as data sensitivity, computational resources, and scalability requirements.\n\n### Local LLMs\n\nLocal LLMs, such as Mistral, Zephyr, and Llama, operate within an organization\u2019s infrastructure, providing complete control over sensitive or proprietary data. This makes them particularly suitable for industries like healthcare and finance, where data privacy and regulatory compliance are critical. Local deployment ensures that no sensitive data leaves the premises, mitigating risks associated with data breaches. However, these models require substantial computational resources, including high-performance GPUs, for efficient operation, which can increase the cost and complexity of deployment.\n\n### API-Based LLMs\n\nAPI-based LLMs, such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT models and Google\u2019s Gemini family, are hosted on cloud platforms and eliminate the need for maintaining extensive infrastructure. They are easy to integrate, benefit from continuous updates, and provide high scalability, making them ideal for applications requiring dynamic workloads.

Formal Language RAG\n\nThe FL RAG system incorporates formal mathematical language, specifically Lean code, into the retrieval process. This approach involves an additional step of translating the NL query into a formal representation before performing retrieval. When the user inputs a mathematical question in NL, the system first translates this query into a Lean formal statement. This translation is accomplished using a fine-tuned version of GPT-4o-mini, which was trained on a dataset [Ying et al., 2024] consisting of pairs of NL statements and their corresponding Lean formalizations.\n\nThe Lean-formatted query is then embedded using text-embeddings-ada-002 (we found text-embeddings-ada-002 to be capable of handling FL as well as text). Next, the query embedding is used to search within a vector database constructed from formal mathematical statements in Lean. This database was created by translating the same MATH dataset [Hendrycks et al., 2021], in order to ensure results aren\u2019t impacted by the knowledge corpus used.\n\nThe system retrieves the top k Lean documents that are semantically similar to the query. These retrieved documents are then combined with the original NL query to form the context for the language model. The combined context and query are input into the GPT-4o model, which generates an answer that incorporates formal reasoning. The system prompt for the model was the same as the one used in the NL RAG, which is \"Solve the following math problem. Give the final answer within {}. Like so: the final answer is {answer}\". The GPT-4o model is prompted with FL context. The generated answer is then presented to the user.\n\n```\nInput query\nGPT 4o-mini Query\nTranslation to LEAN\ntranslated query-\nvector              Relevant\nTranslatedQuery Embedding                         database              Documents-    GPT 40 Answer Generation\nsearch\nAnswer\nFormal Language RAG Flowchart\n```\n\n# C. Model Fine-Tuning\n\nThe fine-tuning of GPT-4o-mini was a critical component of the FL RAG system. We trained the model on the dataset of NL and Lean code pairs, optimizing it to accurately translate NL mathematical statements into Lean code. The prompt used during fine-tuning was \"Translate statement into LEAN:\". The training data used to fine-tune the model are over 10 million tokens worth of statement pairs in NL and FL taken from the Lean Workbook dataset [Ying et al., 2024], each statement in natural language was paired by a translated statement in Lean, and signed with \u201cby sorry\u201d indicating the end of the proof.\n\nThe following is an example of a statement that we translated using the fine-tuned model:\n\n**Example Statement:** Let h(b) = 444*b.

However, their utility in tasks requiring advanced reasoning, such as generating and evaluating mathematical statements and proofs, remains underexplored. This study explores the use of Lean, a programming language for writing mathematical proofs, to populate the knowledge corpus used by RAG systems. We hope for this to lay the foundation to exploring different methods of using RAGs to improve the performance of LLMs in advanced logical reasoning tasks.\n\n----\n\n## I. INTRODUCTION\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, but they still face significant challenges, particularly in generating accurate and reliable information. One of the key issues is their tendency to produce hallucinated or incorrect responses. This has led to the use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAGs) [Gao et al., 2023, Mialon et al., 2023] in an effort to overcome such challenges, since RAGs allow the models to rely on verified external sources of information, which can offer increased accuracy to the generated data and combat hallucinations. However, RAGs still fail to ground LLMs when generating solutions to logical questions, and LLMs still fall short when attempting tasks that require the use of general reasoning skills. This manifests especially when it comes to mathematical reasoning.\n\nOne key issue is the difficulty LLMs face in achieving semantic understanding and contextual reasoning in mathematical language, often leading to incorrect or incomplete formalization of mathematical concepts [Ying et al., 2024]. This gap arises because mathematical language requires a depth of concept comprehension that is challenging to encode in token-based LLM frameworks [Gao et al., 2024]. LLMs also struggle with long-term dependencies inherent in mathematical reasoning, as solutions to mathematical problems often rely on concepts and steps from earlier sections of a text [Lin et al., 2024]. Given the models' limited memory, they have difficulty establishing continuity across extended logical arguments. Precision is another area of difficulty, as the inherent ambiguity in natural language (NL) can lead LLMs to make unintended assumptions, which do not align with the rigor required by mathematical languages [Gao et al., 2024].\n\nMaintaining logical coherence across multiple logical steps is a further challenge; models often create disjointed or incoherent solutions, reflecting an inability to understand the sequence and relationships required in proofs [Ying et al., 2024]. Handling mathematical symbols and complex notations also poses issues since these elements are often misinterpreted by LLMs trained primarily on text rather than on specialized mathematical symbols [Agrawal et al., 2022]. Recursive processes present additional complexity, as they require models to handle multi-layered logical states and iterative reasoning, which LLM architectures are not well-suited to [Xin et al., 2024].\n\nThe study will investigate the use of formalized mathematical statements in Lean, to build a knowledge corpus for the use by RAGs.

However, their utility in tasks requiring advanced reasoning, such as generating and evaluating mathematical statements and proofs, remains underexplored. This study explores the use of Lean, a programming language for writing mathematical proofs, to populate the knowledge corpus used by RAG systems. We hope for this to lay the foundation to exploring different methods of using RAGs to improve the performance of LLMs in advanced logical reasoning tasks.\n\n----\n\n## I. INTRODUCTION\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, but they still face significant challenges, particularly in generating accurate and reliable information. One of the key issues is their tendency to produce hallucinated or incorrect responses. This has led to the use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAGs) [Gao et al., 2023, Mialon et al., 2023] in an effort to overcome such challenges, since RAGs allow the models to rely on verified external sources of information, which can offer increased accuracy to the generated data and combat hallucinations. However, RAGs still fail to ground LLMs when generating solutions to logical questions, and LLMs still fall short when attempting tasks that require the use of general reasoning skills. This manifests especially when it comes to mathematical reasoning.\n\nOne key issue is the difficulty LLMs face in achieving semantic understanding and contextual reasoning in mathematical language, often leading to incorrect or incomplete formalization of mathematical concepts [Ying et al., 2024]. This gap arises because mathematical language requires a depth of concept comprehension that is challenging to encode in token-based LLM frameworks [Gao et al., 2024]. LLMs also struggle with long-term dependencies inherent in mathematical reasoning, as solutions to mathematical problems often rely on concepts and steps from earlier sections of a text [Lin et al., 2024]. Given the models' limited memory, they have difficulty establishing continuity across extended logical arguments. Precision is another area of difficulty, as the inherent ambiguity in natural language (NL) can lead LLMs to make unintended assumptions, which do not align with the rigor required by mathematical languages [Gao et al., 2024].\n\nMaintaining logical coherence across multiple logical steps is a further challenge; models often create disjointed or incoherent solutions, reflecting an inability to understand the sequence and relationships required in proofs [Ying et al., 2024]. Handling mathematical symbols and complex notations also poses issues since these elements are often misinterpreted by LLMs trained primarily on text rather than on specialized mathematical symbols [Agrawal et al., 2022]. Recursive processes present additional complexity, as they require models to handle multi-layered logical states and iterative reasoning, which LLM architectures are not well-suited to [Xin et al., 2024].\n\nThe study will investigate the use of formalized mathematical statements in Lean, to build a knowledge corpus for the use by RAGs. This approach involves translating NL queries into formal language (FL), in order to query and represent data, potentially improving the performance of LLMs in a math-focused question-and-answer (QnA) application. Additionally, we will evaluate this method against established benchmarks, such as the Mathematics Dataset developed by Google [Saxton et al., 2019], in order to gauge its effectiveness compared to traditional RAG configurations that represent and retrieve information in NL.

Formal Language RAG\n\nThe FL RAG system incorporates formal mathematical language, specifically Lean code, into the retrieval process. This approach involves an additional step of translating the NL query into a formal representation before performing retrieval. When the user inputs a mathematical question in NL, the system first translates this query into a Lean formal statement. This translation is accomplished using a fine-tuned version of GPT-4o-mini, which was trained on a dataset [Ying et al., 2024] consisting of pairs of NL statements and their corresponding Lean formalizations.\n\nThe Lean-formatted query is then embedded using text-embeddings-ada-002 (we found text-embeddings-ada-002 to be capable of handling FL as well as text). Next, the query embedding is used to search within a vector database constructed from formal mathematical statements in Lean. This database was created by translating the same MATH dataset [Hendrycks et al., 2021], in order to ensure results aren\u2019t impacted by the knowledge corpus used.\n\nThe system retrieves the top k Lean documents that are semantically similar to the query. These retrieved documents are then combined with the original NL query to form the context for the language model. The combined context and query are input into the GPT-4o model, which generates an answer that incorporates formal reasoning. The system prompt for the model was the same as the one used in the NL RAG, which is \"Solve the following math problem. Give the final answer within {}. Like so: the final answer is {answer}\". The GPT-4o model is prompted with FL context. The generated answer is then presented to the user.\n\n```\nInput query\nGPT 4o-mini Query\nTranslation to LEAN\ntranslated query-\nvector              Relevant\nTranslatedQuery Embedding                         database              Documents-    GPT 40 Answer Generation\nsearch\nAnswer\nFormal Language RAG Flowchart\n```\n\n# C. Model Fine-Tuning\n\nThe fine-tuning of GPT-4o-mini was a critical component of the FL RAG system. We trained the model on the dataset of NL and Lean code pairs, optimizing it to accurately translate NL mathematical statements into Lean code.

Formal Language RAG\n\nThe FL RAG system incorporates formal mathematical language, specifically Lean code, into the retrieval process. This approach involves an additional step of translating the NL query into a formal representation before performing retrieval. When the user inputs a mathematical question in NL, the system first translates this query into a Lean formal statement. This translation is accomplished using a fine-tuned version of GPT-4o-mini, which was trained on a dataset [Ying et al., 2024] consisting of pairs of NL statements and their corresponding Lean formalizations.\n\nThe Lean-formatted query is then embedded using text-embeddings-ada-002 (we found text-embeddings-ada-002 to be capable of handling FL as well as text). Next, the query embedding is used to search within a vector database constructed from formal mathematical statements in Lean. This database was created by translating the same MATH dataset [Hendrycks et al., 2021], in order to ensure results aren\u2019t impacted by the knowledge corpus used.\n\nThe system retrieves the top k Lean documents that are semantically similar to the query. These retrieved documents are then combined with the original NL query to form the context for the language model. The combined context and query are input into the GPT-4o model, which generates an answer that incorporates formal reasoning. The system prompt for the model was the same as the one used in the NL RAG, which is \"Solve the following math problem. Give the final answer within {}. Like so: the final answer is {answer}\". The GPT-4o model is prompted with FL context. The generated answer is then presented to the user.\n\n```\nInput query\nGPT 4o-mini Query\nTranslation to LEAN\ntranslated query-\nvector              Relevant\nTranslatedQuery Embedding                         database              Documents-    GPT 40 Answer Generation\nsearch\nAnswer\nFormal Language RAG Flowchart\n```\n\n# C. Model Fine-Tuning\n\nThe fine-tuning of GPT-4o-mini was a critical component of the FL RAG system. We trained the model on the dataset of NL and Lean code pairs, optimizing it to accurately translate NL mathematical statements into Lean code. The prompt used during fine-tuning was \"Translate statement into LEAN:\".

Feeding the glossary into the graph is crucial because it provides a predefined set of domain-specific terms and definitions that can enhance the semantic richness of the graph. Incorporating the glossary ensures that key terms are properly represented as entities within the graph, improving the traceability and contextual understanding of requirements in relation to higher-level standards and regulations.\n\n**Chunking Documents:** The final step before constructing the graph is to segment cross-referenced documents into manageable text chunks. Chunking is essential to balance the efficiency and accuracy of downstream processes. The size of these chunks significantly impacts the performance of subsequent tasks. Smaller chunks provide better recall of entities and relationships as they fit within the context window of LLMs, minimizing the risk of losing critical information. However, smaller chunks require more processing calls to cover the entire document. Conversely, larger chunks reduce the number of processing calls but may degrade recall due to the limited context-handling capacity of LLMs. Thus, the choice of chunk size represents a trade-off between processing efficiency and the quality of extracted information, making it a crucial consideration in the Graph-RAG pipeline.\n\n----\n\n**Graph-RAG module**\n- **Element Extraction**\n- **Graph Construction**\n- **Community Summarization**\n\n**Cross-reference Documents**\n**Chunked Documents**\n**LLM-based Search and Evaluation**\n**Reference Context**\n**Query LLM**\n**Prompts**\n**Query Graph**\n**Report**\n**Requirement**\n\n*Fig. 2 The automated framework diagram.*"], "title": "", "meta": {"score": 4.92360163, "chunkIndex": 9, "context": "{\"metadata\":{\"filename\":\"2412.08593v1.pdf\",\"lastModified\":\"2024-12-24T20:23:57.624Z\",\"importance\":1,\"contextualRelevance\":1,\"file_path\":\"/tmp/llama_parse_1735071785299_2412.08593v1.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"llama_parse_1735071785299_2412.08593v1.pdf\",\"continuous_mode\":true,\"resultType\":\"markdown\",\"options\":{\"auto_mode\":true,\"auto_mode_trigger_on_table_in_page\":true,\"auto_mode_trigger_on_image_in_page\":true},\"enriched\":true,\"enrichmentTimestamp\":\"2024-12-24T20:23:57.625Z\",\"processingTimestamp\":1735071838836}}", "documentId": "89cb7cbe-9851-415c-9d4d-d127858fa700", "embeddingMetadata": "{\"model\":\"text-embedding-3-large\",\"quality\":{\"l2Norm\":1.0000000104796098,\"meanComponent\":-0.0002400202076193682,\"stdDev\":0.01804059950378397}}", "filename": "2412.08593v1.pdf", "mimeType": "application/pdf", "model": "text-embedding-3-large", "nodeIndex": 9, "originalFormat": "application/pdf", "processingTime": 53538, "processingTimestamp": 1735071838836, "processor": "LlamaParseProcessor", "quality": "{\"l2Norm\":0.9999999932948934,\"meanComponent\":-0.00023703165616503885,\"stdDev\":0.0180406387071524}", "semantic": "{\"type\":\"section\",\"name\":\"section_9\",\"complexity\":{\"cyclomaticComplexity\":1,\"nestingDepth\":0,\"dependencyCount\":0,\"referencedSymbols\":[]}}", "source": "{\"documentId\":\"proj_7a003d9e81dd45dcb08a9de26b3b6ee7_89cb7cbe-9851-415c-9d4d-d127858fa700\",\"mimeType\":\"application/pdf\",\"startLine\":0,\"endLine\":0,\"processingTimestamp\":1735071838836}", "sourceFileBucket": "prod-uploads", "sourceFilePath": "7a003d9e-81dd-45dc-b08a-9de26b3b6ee7/2024-12-24/e3daa621-1297-4207-be2a-266bc2746351_2412.08593v1.pdf", "text": "Document: 2412.08593v1.pdf\nType: application/pdf\nModified: 2024-12-24T20:23:57.624Z\nChunk: 10 of 32\n\n**Extracting the Glossary:** The glossary of terms is extracted as part of pre-processing.

Results from benchmarks on the subset of tasks that involve multi-hop retrieval: BABILong question types 2 and 3, Hash-Hop with 2-6 hash links, and the variable tracing task from RULER. All RAG models tested with k=100. The non-graph baseline RAG models struggle, while the MixPR model is effective across all tasks improving performance over RAG baselines by as much as 50%. Note that although variable tracing is intended to require multi-hop retrieval, the RAG-hybrid model is able to 'shortcut' this task in a single-hop retrieval step. See experiments section for discussion.\n\n----\n\n## Personalization Vector\n\nItems in E are in chronological order. This means the last probability in \u03c0 represents the probability of the last/most recent text chunk. We treat the personalization vector p as a one-hot vector whose last value is set to one and all other values are set to zero (or the last two text chunks are set to .5 when the last chunk is short). In all the datasets we studied, the last sentence or two consist of all or most of the query. Thus, the p vector treats the query node(s) as the start nodes in the distribution of random walks modeled by the PPR distribution, biasing it toward items related to the query.\n\n## Dynamic \u03b1\n\nThe amount the PPR distribution is biased toward p depends on the weight term \u03b1. We hypothesize certain tasks require different levels of query-relatedness. Controlling \u03b1 in our algorithm provides a straightforward method for controlling levels of query-relatedness during retrieval. We tested a wide range of \u03b1 values on tasks that require local, query-dependent retrieval (e.g., QA and NIAH tasks) and tasks that require global, query-independent retrieval (e.g., summarization). We found \u03b1 values between .5 and .99 lead to high retriever recall accuracy across all query-dependent tasks, whereas .1 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 .5 performed slightly worse, and \u03b1 = 0 failed completely. However, on query-independent tasks, smaller \u03b1 values performed better, and \u03b1 = 0 performed best. This justifies our hypothesis and suggests a simple \u03b1-controller that acts as a router for a mixture of two experts: PPR with .5 < \u03b1 for local, query-dependent tasks and PR, i.e., \u03b1 = 0 for global, query-independent tasks. We implemented a simple router that uses the base LLM with a zero-shot prompt. The LLM takes as input the last two and first two sentences of the context and judges whether (\u2019y\u2019 or \u2019n\u2019) the task requires local or global retrieval. We found this method worked nearly perfectly across all the tasks we tested on.\n\n----\n\n## A Fast, Efficient Implementation via Sparse Matrices\n\nIn order to make RAG practical and advantageous over full context methods, our retrieval method must be memory efficient and fast. We achieve this through the use of sparse, keyword-based embeddings stored in sparse matrices implemented using largely standard Python libraries. We use the TF-IDF algorithm to compute the sparse keyword-based embeddings. TF-IDF represents text chunks with word count vectors, which count the number of occurrences of each word within a text chunk then weight this count (inversely) by the word\u2019s frequency across text chunks.

Results from benchmarks on the subset of tasks that involve multi-hop retrieval: BABILong question types 2 and 3, Hash-Hop with 2-6 hash links, and the variable tracing task from RULER. All RAG models tested with k=100. The non-graph baseline RAG models struggle, while the MixPR model is effective across all tasks improving performance over RAG baselines by as much as 50%. Note that although variable tracing is intended to require multi-hop retrieval, the RAG-hybrid model is able to 'shortcut' this task in a single-hop retrieval step. See experiments section for discussion.\n\n----\n\n## Personalization Vector\n\nItems in E are in chronological order. This means the last probability in \u03c0 represents the probability of the last/most recent text chunk. We treat the personalization vector p as a one-hot vector whose last value is set to one and all other values are set to zero (or the last two text chunks are set to .5 when the last chunk is short). In all the datasets we studied, the last sentence or two consist of all or most of the query. Thus, the p vector treats the query node(s) as the start nodes in the distribution of random walks modeled by the PPR distribution, biasing it toward items related to the query.\n\n## Dynamic \u03b1\n\nThe amount the PPR distribution is biased toward p depends on the weight term \u03b1. We hypothesize certain tasks require different levels of query-relatedness. Controlling \u03b1 in our algorithm provides a straightforward method for controlling levels of query-relatedness during retrieval. We tested a wide range of \u03b1 values on tasks that require local, query-dependent retrieval (e.g., QA and NIAH tasks) and tasks that require global, query-independent retrieval (e.g., summarization). We found \u03b1 values between .5 and .99 lead to high retriever recall accuracy across all query-dependent tasks, whereas .1 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 .5 performed slightly worse, and \u03b1 = 0 failed completely. However, on query-independent tasks, smaller \u03b1 values performed better, and \u03b1 = 0 performed best. This justifies our hypothesis and suggests a simple \u03b1-controller that acts as a router for a mixture of two experts: PPR with .5 < \u03b1 for local, query-dependent tasks and PR, i.e., \u03b1 = 0 for global, query-independent tasks. We implemented a simple router that uses the base LLM with a zero-shot prompt. The LLM takes as input the last two and first two sentences of the context and judges whether (\u2019y\u2019 or \u2019n\u2019) the task requires local or global retrieval. We found this method worked nearly perfectly across all the tasks we tested on.\n\n----\n\n## A Fast, Efficient Implementation via Sparse Matrices\n\nIn order to make RAG practical and advantageous over full context methods, our retrieval method must be memory efficient and fast. We achieve this through the use of sparse, keyword-based embeddings stored in sparse matrices implemented using largely standard Python libraries. We use the TF-IDF algorithm to compute the sparse keyword-based embeddings. TF-IDF represents text chunks with word count vectors, which count the number of occurrences of each word within a text chunk then weight this count (inversely) by the word\u2019s frequency across text chunks. As we show below, MixPR and its implementation embed text chunks much faster on a CPU than dense embedders do on a GPU. Embeddings are stored in sparse matrices, via the SciPy library. These matrices are highly memory efficient, only storing non-zero values, and the matrix multiplication used in our PPR retriever can be done fast, entirely on the CPU.

In example 2 we see a trick question where the NL RAG was tricked but the FL RAG wasn\u2019t, probably due to the extra layer of formalization.

CONCLUSION\n\nThis study investigated the integration of formal mathematical language, specifically Lean code, into RAGs to enhance the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs. By constructing a knowledge corpus composed of formalized mathematical statements and proofs, and translating NL queries into formal representations, we aimed to improve LLM performance in advanced logical reasoning tasks. The evaluation conducted using the Mathematics Dataset developed by Google [Saxton et al., 2019] demonstrated that the FL RAG achieved an average answer correctness of 73%, outperforming the NL RAG system, which achieved 54%. This significant improvement suggests that incorporating FL into the RAG process can yield advantages over conventional NL-based approaches in mathematical problem-solving. Notably, the knowledge corpus used in the FL RAG consisted of the same NL statements from the NL RAG translated into Lean.

In many instances, the Lean translator was observed to attempt to solve the questions by providing a solution as part of the statement (sometimes incorrectly). This could inadvertently provide the LLM with more context or hints toward the correct answer.\n\nAnother potential factor is that the use of Lean in querying the LLM may help it access more mathematically accurate portions of its training data.

Examples\n\nThe following are examples of questions from the test dataset along with their answers according to the models tested:\n\n1) **Question:** Solve 312*s + 276*s - 661*s + 952 = -362 for s.\n**Real Answer:** 18\n**NL RAG Answer:** The final answer is {1}.\n**FL RAG Answer:** The final answer is {18}.\n\n2) **Question:** In base 10, what is -15 - -839090?\n**Real Answer:** 839075\n**NL RAG Answer:** The final answer is {-839075}.\n**FL RAG Answer:** Therefore, the final answer is {839075}.\n\n3) **Question:** What is the difference between -988.36 and -73357.6?\n**Real Answer:** 72369.24\n**NL RAG Answer:** The final answer is {72369.24}.\n**FL RAG Answer:** It seems like you might have entered a statement instead of a math problem. Could you please provide the math problem you would like me to solve?\n\n4) **Question:** Find the second derivative of 10490087*j*z**2 - 4460*j - 179*z wrt z.\n**Real Answer:** 20980174*j\n**NL RAG Answer:** The final answer is ({2 cdot 10490087 cdot j}).\n**FL RAG Answer:** The final answer is {20980174 * j}.\n\n5) **Question:** Suppose 27*t = 43 + 11. Let f be (t + (-111)/(-12))/((-2)/(-8)). What is the highest common divisor of f and 15?\n**Real Answer:** 15\n**NL RAG Answer:** Thus, the final answer is {15}.\n**FL RAG Answer:** The final answer is {3}.\n\nWe can see in examples 1 and 5 instances where the NL RAG was simply more accurate. In example 4 we see an instance where both answered correctly, but the NL RAG didn\u2019t quite give a final answer. In example 2 we see a trick question where the NL RAG was tricked but the FL RAG wasn\u2019t, probably due to the extra layer of formalization. In example 3 we see an instance where the NL RAG answered correctly, but the FL RAG didn\u2019t answer at all, probably an issue with the translation to FL.\n\n# V. CONCLUSION\n\nThis study investigated the integration of formal mathematical language, specifically Lean code, into RAGs to enhance the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs. By constructing a knowledge corpus composed of formalized mathematical statements and proofs, and translating NL queries into formal representations, we aimed to improve LLM performance in advanced logical reasoning tasks. The evaluation conducted using the Mathematics Dataset developed by Google [Saxton et al., 2019] demonstrated that the FL RAG achieved an average answer correctness of 73%, outperforming the NL RAG system, which achieved 54%. This significant improvement suggests that incorporating FL into the RAG process can yield advantages over conventional NL-based approaches in mathematical problem-solving. Notably, the knowledge corpus used in the FL RAG consisted of the same NL statements from the NL RAG translated into Lean. Therefore, even with potential mistakes and inaccuracies in the translation process\u2014both when translating the query in real time and in creating the FL knowledge corpus\u2014these improvements were achieved.\n\n# VI. DISCUSSION\n\nWhile we can only speculate about the underlying reasons for the performance boost observed with the FL configuration, several factors may contribute to this improvement. One possible reason is the additional processing involved in the translation step. In many instances, the Lean translator was observed to attempt to solve the questions by providing a solution as part of the statement (sometimes incorrectly). This could inadvertently provide the LLM with more context or hints toward the correct answer.\n\nAnother potential factor is that the use of Lean in querying the LLM may help it access more mathematically accurate portions of its training data. Since data written in Lean is likely to be a more precise and rigorous source of mathematical knowledge than data in other languages, incorporating Lean code could enhance the model's reasoning capabilities.", "tokenCount": 975, "transformConfig": "{\"mode\":\"default\",\"options\":{\"auto_mode\":true,\"continuous_mode\":true}}", "hybridScore": "4.89142942"}, "citation_uuid": -1}, {"url": "8dd13cd3-8cec-40f4-b5da-ca229645cf83", "description": "", "snippets": ["Document: 2412.05223v1.pdf\nType: application/pdf\nModified: 2024-12-24T20:29:08.349Z\nChunk: 3 of 12\n\n**CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT:**\n\nA handful of \"features\" in their neural networks that are important to producing any given output. These features are akin to the small set of concepts a person might have in mind when reasoning about a situation. We refer to such features as Noun-Phrases, and our Noun-Phrase Dominance Model that predates the OpenAI and Anthropic studies posited that LLMs self-organize around such noun phrases during training [13].\n\n**Long Context RAG**\nRecently, LLMs have greatly increased their context window, allowing a very large amount of text to be sent along with the prompt. Before the advent of long-context language models, RAG was a key solution for overcoming the limitations of small context window sizes. Some researchers have examined if a sufficiently large context window could effectively replace RAG altogether. Databricks examined the effects of increased context size on various modern LLMs. The net result was that no LLM, regardless of the amount of data sent to it, was able to exceed greater than 80% accuracy on various QA benchmarks [6].\n\n**Faithfulness and Correctness**\nTwo terms that are important to understand as it relates to evaluating RAG and LLMs are Faithfulness and Correctness. Faithfulness evaluates whether the generated output accurately reflects the information contained in the retrieved documents [14]. A response is considered faithful if it does not introduce information that is absent from the retrieved sources, and adheres closely to the input data. This criterion measures how consistently the LLM response aligns with the retrieved content. A perfect faithfulness score means there is no \"hallucination\" caused by deviation from the content (such as by introducing new facts or interpretations). In other words, a faithful response directly reflects the content of the retrieved documents, with all statements fully supported by the retrieved data.\n\nCorrectness, on the other hand, assesses the factual accuracy of the output within a broader context [14]. A response is deemed correct if it aligns with established facts, even when those facts are not explicitly present in the retrieved documents. Correctness measures how well the generated answer matches verified external knowledge. For instance, a correct response is factually accurate based on real-world information, even if some of that information originates from the model\u2019s parametric knowledge rather than the retrieved (non-parametric) sources. Faithfulness ensures that the response stays true to the retrieved information, while correctness ensures that the response is factually accurate, regardless of its source.\n\n**Explanation of Acurai Terms**\nWe use the terms \"accurate\" and \"faithful\" herein interchangeably. For our primary use case (enterprise chatbots), the goal is to provide answers that are faithful to the information provided. For example, if an enterprise customer is a car company, they want their chatbot to be faithful to the documents provided to the chatbot, which may say their cars are \"the best\". This faithful answer may not be an objectively quantifiable answer; and perhaps even according to a third party, this company\u2019s cars are not, in fact, \"the best\". In many chatbots, correctness can be ambiguous or debatable, depending on the topic and question asked (\"Who is the greatest opera singer of all time?\"), whereas faithfulness can always be measured in concrete terms.\n\nIn a RAG-based chatbot, we refer to hallucinations as referring to any deviation from the provided context. Importantly, LLMs can still hallucinate even when clearly written facts are sent along with the query. For example, ChatGPT-3.5 Turbo was provided the following clearly written statements about calcium: \"Calcium is a sliver-grey metal. Calcium melts at 840\u00b0C. Calcium boils at 1484\u00b0C to produce monatomic gas. ...\" Remarkably, the LLM stated that all these properties belonged to magnesium when given the following instruction: \"Extract all facts about magnesium from the following passages.\" [15] The calcium statements could not be more clearly written. The prompt also clearly asks about magnesium. Nevertheless, the LLM treated magnesium as if it is the same thing as calcium. Acurai\u2019s Noun-Phrase Dominance Model says that all hallucinations occur when the LLM mistakes two distinct Noun-Phrases as being the same thing. More specifically, the LLM does so when the distinct noun phrases are semantically similar, such as is the case with calcium and magnesium [16]."], "title": "", "meta": {"score": 4.88261175, "chunkIndex": 2, "context": "{\"metadata\":{\"filename\":\"2412.05223v1.pdf\",\"lastModified\":\"2024-12-24T20:29:08.349Z\",\"importance\":1,\"contextualRelevance\":1,\"file_path\":\"/tmp/llama_parse_1735072142721_2412.05223v1.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"llama_parse_1735072142721_2412.05223v1.pdf\",\"continuous_mode\":true,\"resultType\":\"markdown\",\"options\":{\"auto_mode\":true,\"auto_mode_trigger_on_table_in_page\":true,\"auto_mode_trigger_on_image_in_page\":true},\"enriched\":true,\"enrichmentTimestamp\":\"2024-12-24T20:29:08.349Z\",\"processingTimestamp\":1735072149236}}", "documentId": "b26a8577-1b29-4b7e-bc66-8356fd2e4df7", "embeddingMetadata": "{\"model\":\"text-embedding-3-large\",\"quality\":{\"l2Norm\":1.0000000595116685,\"meanComponent\":-0.00040061394320540394,\"stdDev\":0.01803774876603008}}", "filename": "2412.05223v1.pdf", "mimeType": "application/pdf", "model": "text-embedding-3-large", "nodeIndex": 2, "originalFormat": "application/pdf", "processingTime": 6515, "processingTimestamp": 1735072149236, "processor": "LlamaParseProcessor", "quality": "{\"l2Norm\":1.0000000196273633,\"meanComponent\":-0.0003968449089041993,\"stdDev\":0.018037831361608882}", "semantic": "{\"type\":\"section\",\"name\":\"section_2\",\"complexity\":{\"cyclomaticComplexity\":1,\"nestingDepth\":0,\"dependencyCount\":0,\"referencedSymbols\":[]}}", "source": "{\"documentId\":\"proj_7a003d9e81dd45dcb08a9de26b3b6ee7_b26a8577-1b29-4b7e-bc66-8356fd2e4df7\",\"mimeType\":\"application/pdf\",\"startLine\":0,\"endLine\":0,\"processingTimestamp\":1735072149236}", "sourceFileBucket": "prod-uploads", "sourceFilePath": "7a003d9e-81dd-45dc-b08a-9de26b3b6ee7/2024-12-24/77bcd1dd-0b5c-4a14-8122-c86134716d10_2412.05223v1.pdf", "text": "Document: 2412.05223v1.pdf\nType: application/pdf\nModified: 2024-12-24T20:29:08.349Z\nChunk: 3 of 12\n\n**CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT:**\n\nA handful of \"features\" in their neural networks that are important to producing any given output.

By enabling real-time, context-aware decision-making, RAG helps provide reliable information about the network environment. For example, the authors in [8] introduced a 6G AI agent based on the LangChain framework, incorporating RAG and GPT-4 Turbo. Its performance is assessed across three autonomous driving scenarios, demonstrating effectiveness in real-time road updates, network configuration for tailored requests, and D2D vehicle communication. Results confirm its ability to enhance network reliability and performance significantly.\n\n## RAG Limitations\nDespite RAG\u2019s advancements in enhancing generative model performance through retrieval, it has certain limitations:\n\n1. **Lack of Contextual Awareness**: RAG can struggle with capturing full contextual information, especially with interrelated entities across multiple document sections or crucial data embedded in the middle of text. Experiments in [9] show that when using GPT-3.5-Turbo for multi-document QA tasks, performance drops by over 20% if key information is positioned mid-context rather than at the beginning or end. This decline is more pronounced as the number of retrieved documents increases, highlighting RAG\u2019s limited contextual awareness. In the context of networking, this weakness in missing information located in the middle of the database can raise problems with inaccurate mapping of network information, such as the connection information among devices.\n\n2. **Incomplete Retrievals**: RAG may retrieve irrelevant or partially relevant data due to its lack of structured understanding of relationships between data points. As experiments in [10] demonstrate, irrelevant content within the same topic can significantly impact LLM performance, decreasing generation accuracy by over 10%. This issue underscores RAG\u2019s difficulty in consistently providing comprehensive and accurate outputs. In the context of network optimization, such inaccurate retrieval can provide significantly negative influences on the decision-making process.\n\n3. **Challenges with Complex Queries**: RAG has limitations when handling complex queries that require synthesizing information from multiple sources or summarizing large documents. For instance, multi-document summarization experiments in [11] show that models including T5, BART, and PEGASUS achieve low ROUGE-L scores (below 0.2) on complex summarization tasks, indicating difficulty in generating cohesive summaries across related content. In the context of networking, lacking the capability to handle complex queries and summarize information can result in difficulties in obtaining a comprehensive overview of the network environment.\n\n## GraphRAG: Take One Step Further\nDespite previous enhancements, RAG\u2019s effectiveness in query-focused abstractive summarization over entire corpora remains limited. To address this, GraphRAG combines the strengths of RAG and knowledge graphs, overcoming each framework\u2019s limitations while enhancing its advantages.\n\n1. **Database Structure**: GraphRAG builds upon RAG\u2019s core features, adding a graph-structured database where entities and relationships are extracted by LLMs. Flat text chunks are mapped to entities and relationships within the knowledge graph, with vector embeddings facilitating retrieval. Furthermore, entities are organized into topic-centered communities through clustering algorithms, enabling retrieval from varying levels of abstraction and providing multi-angled insights into the database. In network applications, for example, such database structure can be obtained through the extraction of the interconnections among network devices, with entities representing the devices and relationships (edges) representing the connections.\n\n2. **Enhanced Retrieval Methods**: GraphRAG supports two synergistic retrieval modes: Local Search and Global Search. For Local Search, this method retrieves entity-specific information by traversing the graph\u2019s nodes (entities) and edges (relationships), capturing complex interdependencies to respond effectively to specific queries. For Global Search, Community-based retrieval uses summaries of topic-centered communities to answer broader queries. For example, considering a knowledge graph representing the network environment, the retrieval starts from the queried devices in the knowledge graph, then moves along their connections, and finally incorporates the explored information to identify the internet information (e.g., channel information, interconnections) around the queried devices.\n\nThe key characteristics of GraphRAG can be summarized in Figure 2. As a validation of GraphRAG\u2019s advantages, experiments in [12] comparing GraphRAG and vanilla RAG on various generation tasks demonstrated that GraphRAG improves answer comprehensiveness, diversity, and empowerment by approximately 30%, producing more contextually helpful responses. In networking optimization, GraphRAG offers distinct advantages, including:\n\n- **Enhanced Contextual Understanding**: GraphRAG leverages the inherent relationships between entities in a knowledge graph, enabling a deeper and more accurate understanding of context. It is able to assess the relevance of retrieved documents based on their relationships and connections, leading to more contextually appropriate retrieval.

As a validation of GraphRAG\u2019s advantages, experiments in [12] comparing GraphRAG and vanilla RAG on various generation tasks demonstrated that GraphRAG improves answer comprehensiveness, diversity, and empowerment by approximately 30%, producing more contextually helpful responses. In networking optimization, GraphRAG offers distinct advantages, including:\n\n- **Enhanced Contextual Understanding**: GraphRAG leverages the inherent relationships between entities in a knowledge graph, enabling a deeper and more accurate understanding of context. It is able to assess the relevance of retrieved documents based on their relationships and connections, leading to more contextually appropriate retrieval. This characteristic of GraphRAG is particularly beneficial in networking applications.", "tokenCount": 1402, "transformConfig": "{\"mode\":\"default\",\"options\":{\"auto_mode\":true,\"continuous_mode\":true}}", "hybridScore": "4.88054895"}, "citation_uuid": -1}, {"url": "bffbfc1d-6186-4e9e-a7b9-da9606227a5a", "description": "", "snippets": ["Document: 2411.13773v1.pdf\nType: application/pdf\nModified: 2024-12-24T20:46:46.094Z\nChunk: 2 of 9\n\n# Configuration Tasks in Network Management\n\nRecent studies have explored LLMs\u2019 potential to generate network configurations [10]\u2013[12], detect anomalies [13], and convert textual descriptions into formal specifications [14], [15]. These contributions represent the most frequent applications of LLMs to network management, aiming to reduce manual labor and risks of errors. The work proposed in this paper is complementary to these approaches as they may rely on RAG systems to retrieve network-specific information.\n\n## Application of RAG in Network Management\n\nThe application of RAG within network management has been less explored. RAGLog [16] introduces a novel method for detecting log anomalies using a combination of vector databases and LLMs. This approach allows for the detection of anomalies based on raw log data, adapting to various log sources without extensive preprocessing. While promising for its adaptability, RAGLog encounters challenges related to resource consumption and latency, which could limit its scalability in larger network data.\n\nTelco-RAG [17] targets the processing of 3GPP documents. A pipeline with query enhancement demonstrates improvements in the accuracy of LLMs when handling complex questions related to the telecommunication domain.\n\n## VectorRAG and GraphRAG Approaches\n\nMore generally, VectorRAG, the predominant approach in RAG systems, computes vector embeddings for fixed-size chunks and uses semantic similarity to retrieve information relevant to the input query. However, this method struggles with the nature of network data where domain-specific keywords have different meanings in their context.\n\nGraphRAG [9] is a more advanced approach that integrates KGs with text chunking and embedding. The LLM is used to extract entities and relationships and summarize communities detected in the KG, providing a more structured retrieval (also uses semantic similarity). Although GraphRAG is efficient in summarizing and reporting tasks (see Figure 1a), it falls short in delivering useful answers, particularly when the query includes specific values, such as names or types, that need to be matched exactly in the retrieval as reported in Figure 1b.\n\nHybridRAG [8] combines GraphRAG and VectorRAG. Although this hybrid approach enhances the accuracy and contextual relevance of responses, it inherits the limitations of its base approaches. Another approach uses entity-relationship extraction to create a KG capturing the important information of the source data. The KG is then searched like a database by translating the textual query into a database query [18]. While this allows for accurate retrieval, it can be impractical given the imperfect parsing obtained with LLMs; as shown in Figure 2 where we tested the accuracy of LLM-based configuration parsing against Batfish [2].\n\n## FastRAG: A New Approach\n\nTo address these limitations, FastRAG extracts entities and their properties from source data while mapping each entity to specific lines of the original text. This method enables accurate retrieval using a KG while allowing for text search to handle vague queries and compensate for imperfect entity extraction. Text search, unlike semantic similarity, matches text based on exact wording or structure [19]. Both KG and text searches are performed using GQL queries on a single KG implemented in a graph database. Unlike other methods, FastRAG avoids costly processing of all source data through LLMs by generating JSON schemas and Python code for data structuring and parsing. While demonstrated on logs and configuration data, this approach can be applied to other semi-structured data, such as playbooks and alarms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first RAG system to rely solely on code generation for data processing.\n\n## Example Queries and Responses\n\n```plaintext\n% python ~m graphrag query ~~root ~~method global \"list the interfaces of boza_rtr\"\n```\nCreating LLM client request...\n\n**SUCCESS: Global Search Response:**\n### Interfaces\nThe Boza_RTR router has several interfaces configured for various roles within the network.

In these domains, maintaining consistency, adhering to regulatory frameworks, minimizing errors, and meeting critical expectations are essential for the reliable functioning of systems. The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) highlights their immense potential, yet there remains considerable scope for improvement in retrieving relevant information and enhancing reasoning capabilities. This study demonstrates that integrating a robust Graph-RAG framework with advanced prompt engineering techniques, such as Chain of Thought and Tree of Thought, can significantly enhance performance. Compared to baseline RAG methods and simple prompting strategies, this approach delivers more accurate and context-aware results.

It addresses the limitations of traditional LLMs, such as weak reasoning and context handling, by using evidence-based reasoning to guide response generation. This approach simplifies the process by having a single agent retrieve and use relevant evidence for better output. The study shows that single-agent RAG systems can achieve strong performance in knowledge-intensive tasks, offering a more efficient alternative to multi-agent systems while still delivering high-quality results.\n\nThe Speculative RAG framework enhances single-agent RAG systems by using a two-LM approach for improved efficiency and accuracy. A smaller, distilled specialist LM drafts multiple responses from different document subsets, while a larger generalist LM verifies these drafts in a single pass. This method reduces token use, mitigates position bias, and speeds up processing. Extensive testing on benchmarks such as TriviaQA, MuSiQue, PubHealth, and ARC-Challenge shows that Speculative RAG boosts accuracy by up to 12.97% and cuts latency by 51% compared to conventional RAG systems, setting a new standard for single-agent RAG performance.\n\nAlthough pre-trained language models are good at storing knowledge, they have trouble updating and precisely accessing it, particularly when performing knowledge-intensive operations. To overcome this, RAG models integrate non-parametric memory, such as a vector index of Wikipedia, that is retrieved by a neural retriever with pre-trained parametric memory. This method enhances the model\u2019s capacity to produce precise and accurate answers. There are two primary RAG approaches: one modifies the retrieved passages per token, while the other uses the same passages throughout the output. Optimized RAG models have demonstrated improved generation quality and factual correctness on open-domain QA tasks, outperforming task-specific architectures and conventional parametric models.\n\n### 3.2 Multi-Agent Systems in AI\nBy focusing on relevant feedback and multi-agent communication patterns, this work examines how large language models (LLMs) might improve Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems for technical support. Larger models outperform traditional approaches in determining relevance, according to experiments with LLMs such as GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, and Llama3. However, smaller models, such as Llama3, produced comparable findings when given appropriate prompts.

(2024) demonstrate how BERT, a Large Language Model, is employed to detect and address incomplete requirements by predicting missing terminology, thereby improving the overall completeness of SRS. In addition to enhancing completeness, LLMs have also shown promise in ensuring regulatory compliance. For instance, the study by Hassani et al. (2024) illustrates how Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) can be evaluated for compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a legal framework aimed at ensuring data privacy in the European Union, using advanced techniques powered by Large Language Models.

These challenges include difficulties in maintaining context across extensive documents, which can result in incomplete or inaccurate analysis during requirement compliance checks. A potential solution is to provide the most relevant reference text, allowing for more precise validation of whether a requirement is being violated (Spoletini and Ferrari, 2024). Moreover, hallucination, where models generate factually incorrect yet plausible content, remains a critical issue, particularly when retrieval mechanisms are insufficient and reasoning capabilities fail. Additionally, scalability and performance constraints limit their effectiveness in large, complex projects, and inherent biases in LLMs can result in prioritizing common problems over more nuanced, domain-specific issues (Huang et al., 2023).\n\nIn this work, we propose an automated framework to address the challenges of validating SRS in regulated environments.

LLMs serve as the foundation for query generation and response synthesis, but their token limits and processing capabilities significantly impact the system\u2019s efficiency and scalability. LLMs can be broadly categorized into two types: local models and API-based models. Both categories have unique advantages and challenges, making the decision highly dependent on factors such as data sensitivity, computational resources, and scalability requirements.\n\n### Local LLMs\n\nLocal LLMs, such as Mistral, Zephyr, and Llama, operate within an organization\u2019s infrastructure, providing complete control over sensitive or proprietary data. This makes them particularly suitable for industries like healthcare and finance, where data privacy and regulatory compliance are critical. Local deployment ensures that no sensitive data leaves the premises, mitigating risks associated with data breaches. However, these models require substantial computational resources, including high-performance GPUs, for efficient operation, which can increase the cost and complexity of deployment.\n\n### API-Based LLMs\n\nAPI-based LLMs, such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT models and Google\u2019s Gemini family, are hosted on cloud platforms and eliminate the need for maintaining extensive infrastructure. They are easy to integrate, benefit from continuous updates, and provide high scalability, making them ideal for applications requiring dynamic workloads.

LLMs serve as the foundation for query generation and response synthesis, but their token limits and processing capabilities significantly impact the system\u2019s efficiency and scalability. LLMs can be broadly categorized into two types: local models and API-based models. Both categories have unique advantages and challenges, making the decision highly dependent on factors such as data sensitivity, computational resources, and scalability requirements.\n\n### Local LLMs\n\nLocal LLMs, such as Mistral, Zephyr, and Llama, operate within an organization\u2019s infrastructure, providing complete control over sensitive or proprietary data. This makes them particularly suitable for industries like healthcare and finance, where data privacy and regulatory compliance are critical. Local deployment ensures that no sensitive data leaves the premises, mitigating risks associated with data breaches. However, these models require substantial computational resources, including high-performance GPUs, for efficient operation, which can increase the cost and complexity of deployment.\n\n### API-Based LLMs\n\nAPI-based LLMs, such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT models and Google\u2019s Gemini family, are hosted on cloud platforms and eliminate the need for maintaining extensive infrastructure. They are easy to integrate, benefit from continuous updates, and provide high scalability, making them ideal for applications requiring dynamic workloads. Despite these advantages, API-based models introduce concerns regarding data privacy, as sensitive information must be transmitted to external servers for processing. Additionally, their token-based pricing models can lead to unpredictable costs for applications with heavy usage.\n\n### Token Constraints\n\nToken constraints further influence the choice of LLMs in RAG systems.

Project managers typically respond to a Red status by prioritizing immediate actions to address the critical issues. This may involve reallocating resources, implementing contingency plans, or escalating the issue to higher management. The aim is to resolve the underlying problems swiftly to prevent further delays or cost overruns.\n\n2. **Amber**: An Amber status suggests that while there are concerns, they are not critical at the moment.

It begins by embedding documents into dense vector representations using a pre-trained Sentence-Transformer model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2). These embeddings enable efficient retrieval of relevant content. When a query is input, the system computes its embedding and identifies the most similar documents from the indexed collection. The retrieved documents are then formatted into a prompt, providing context for the generative model (GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini) to answer the query. This approach ensures that responses are informed by the retrieved context, making it effective for tasks requiring direct access to relevant information.

Subsequently, we assess its reasoning ability to determine the alignment between the retrieved reference content and the given requirement.\n\nThis baseline RAG implementation combines dense retrieval with a generative language model to deliver context-aware answers (Lewis et al., 2020). It begins by embedding documents into dense vector representations using a pre-trained Sentence-Transformer model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2). These embeddings enable efficient retrieval of relevant content. When a query is input, the system computes its embedding and identifies the most similar documents from the indexed collection. The retrieved documents are then formatted into a prompt, providing context for the generative model (GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini) to answer the query. This approach ensures that responses are informed by the retrieved context, making it effective for tasks requiring direct access to relevant information. However, it does not account for complex relationships or structured dependencies between entities, serving as a baseline for comparison with more advanced systems like Graph-RAG.", "tokenCount": 820, "transformConfig": "{\"mode\":\"default\",\"options\":{\"auto_mode\":true,\"continuous_mode\":true}}", "hybridScore": "5.36988592"}, "citation_uuid": -1}, {"url": "88c90bd6-fc24-400e-9fe0-0f522eec2e63", "description": "", "snippets": ["Document: 2412.08593v1.pdf\nType: application/pdf\nModified: 2024-12-24T20:23:57.624Z\nChunk: 1 of 32\n\n# Leveraging Graph-RAG and Prompt Engineering to Enhance LLM-Based Automated Requirement Traceability and Compliance Checks\n\n**Arsalan Masoudifard\u00b9*, Mohammad Mowlavi Sorond\u00b9, Moein Madadi\u00b9, Mohammad Sabokrou\u00b2, Elahe Habibi\u00b9**\n\u00b9Department of Computer Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran.\n\u00b2Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology, Okinawa, Japan.\n\n*Corresponding author(s).

Conversely, larger chunks reduce the number of processing calls but may degrade recall due to the limited context-handling capacity of LLMs. Thus, the choice of chunk size represents a trade-off between processing efficiency and the quality of extracted information, making it a crucial consideration in the Graph-RAG pipeline.\n\n----\n\n**Graph-RAG module**\n- **Element Extraction**\n- **Graph Construction**\n- **Community Summarization**\n\n**Cross-reference Documents**\n**Chunked Documents**\n**LLM-based Search and Evaluation**\n**Reference Context**\n**Query LLM**\n**Prompts**\n**Query Graph**\n**Report**\n**Requirement**\n\n*Fig. 2 The automated framework diagram.*", "tokenCount": 455, "transformConfig": "{\"mode\":\"default\",\"options\":{\"auto_mode\":true,\"continuous_mode\":true}}", "hybridScore": "5.31861401"}, "citation_uuid": -1}, {"url": "74a2e0d5-2d2e-4ed3-93fd-5d61722a5964", "description": "", "snippets": ["Document: 2412.05838v1.pdf\nType: application/pdf\nModified: 2024-12-24T20:28:56.762Z\nChunk: 6 of 16\n\n# Relationships\n- COLLABORATES_WITH\n- WORKS_ON\n\n## Example 1:\n**Question:** List all collaborators of Arnab Mitra Utsab.\n**Generated Query:**\n```\nMATCH (r:Researcher {name: 'Arnab Mitra Utsab'})-[:COLLABORATES_WITH]->(collaborator:Researcher)\nRETURN collaborator.name;\n```\n\n## Example 2:\n**Question:** Find researchers working on AI projects in the domain of healthcare.\n**Generated Query:**\n```\nMATCH (r:Researcher)-[:WORKS_ON]->(project)\nWHERE project.domain = 'AI in Healthcare'\nRETURN r.name;\n```\n\n----\n\n## 3 Related Work and Research Contributions\n\n### 3.1 Single-Agent RAG Systems\nThis study focuses on improving Single-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to solve complex problems more effectively.

By enabling real-time, context-aware decision-making, RAG helps provide reliable information about the network environment. For example, the authors in [8] introduced a 6G AI agent based on the LangChain framework, incorporating RAG and GPT-4 Turbo. Its performance is assessed across three autonomous driving scenarios, demonstrating effectiveness in real-time road updates, network configuration for tailored requests, and D2D vehicle communication. Results confirm its ability to enhance network reliability and performance significantly.\n\n## RAG Limitations\nDespite RAG\u2019s advancements in enhancing generative model performance through retrieval, it has certain limitations:\n\n1. **Lack of Contextual Awareness**: RAG can struggle with capturing full contextual information, especially with interrelated entities across multiple document sections or crucial data embedded in the middle of text. Experiments in [9] show that when using GPT-3.5-Turbo for multi-document QA tasks, performance drops by over 20% if key information is positioned mid-context rather than at the beginning or end. This decline is more pronounced as the number of retrieved documents increases, highlighting RAG\u2019s limited contextual awareness. In the context of networking, this weakness in missing information located in the middle of the database can raise problems with inaccurate mapping of network information, such as the connection information among devices.\n\n2. **Incomplete Retrievals**: RAG may retrieve irrelevant or partially relevant data due to its lack of structured understanding of relationships between data points. As experiments in [10] demonstrate, irrelevant content within the same topic can significantly impact LLM performance, decreasing generation accuracy by over 10%. This issue underscores RAG\u2019s difficulty in consistently providing comprehensive and accurate outputs. In the context of network optimization, such inaccurate retrieval can provide significantly negative influences on the decision-making process.\n\n3. **Challenges with Complex Queries**: RAG has limitations when handling complex queries that require synthesizing information from multiple sources or summarizing large documents. For instance, multi-document summarization experiments in [11] show that models including T5, BART, and PEGASUS achieve low ROUGE-L scores (below 0.2) on complex summarization tasks, indicating difficulty in generating cohesive summaries across related content. In the context of networking, lacking the capability to handle complex queries and summarize information can result in difficulties in obtaining a comprehensive overview of the network environment.\n\n## GraphRAG: Take One Step Further\nDespite previous enhancements, RAG\u2019s effectiveness in query-focused abstractive summarization over entire corpora remains limited. To address this, GraphRAG combines the strengths of RAG and knowledge graphs, overcoming each framework\u2019s limitations while enhancing its advantages.\n\n1. **Database Structure**: GraphRAG builds upon RAG\u2019s core features, adding a graph-structured database where entities and relationships are extracted by LLMs. Flat text chunks are mapped to entities and relationships within the knowledge graph, with vector embeddings facilitating retrieval. Furthermore, entities are organized into topic-centered communities through clustering algorithms, enabling retrieval from varying levels of abstraction and providing multi-angled insights into the database. In network applications, for example, such database structure can be obtained through the extraction of the interconnections among network devices, with entities representing the devices and relationships (edges) representing the connections.\n\n2. **Enhanced Retrieval Methods**: GraphRAG supports two synergistic retrieval modes: Local Search and Global Search. For Local Search, this method retrieves entity-specific information by traversing the graph\u2019s nodes (entities) and edges (relationships), capturing complex interdependencies to respond effectively to specific queries. For Global Search, Community-based retrieval uses summaries of topic-centered communities to answer broader queries. For example, considering a knowledge graph representing the network environment, the retrieval starts from the queried devices in the knowledge graph, then moves along their connections, and finally incorporates the explored information to identify the internet information (e.g., channel information, interconnections) around the queried devices.\n\nThe key characteristics of GraphRAG can be summarized in Figure 2. As a validation of GraphRAG\u2019s advantages, experiments in [12] comparing GraphRAG and vanilla RAG on various generation tasks demonstrated that GraphRAG improves answer comprehensiveness, diversity, and empowerment by approximately 30%, producing more contextually helpful responses. In networking optimization, GraphRAG offers distinct advantages, including:\n\n- **Enhanced Contextual Understanding**: GraphRAG leverages the inherent relationships between entities in a knowledge graph, enabling a deeper and more accurate understanding of context. It is able to assess the relevance of retrieved documents based on their relationships and connections, leading to more contextually appropriate retrieval. This characteristic of GraphRAG is particularly beneficial in networking applications."], "title": "", "meta": {"score": 5.29871273, "chunkIndex": 3, "context": "{\"metadata\":{\"filename\":\"2412.07189v1.pdf\",\"lastModified\":\"2024-12-24T20:46:51.699Z\",\"importance\":1,\"contextualRelevance\":1,\"file_path\":\"/tmp/llama_parse_1735073159634_2412.07189v1.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"llama_parse_1735073159634_2412.07189v1.pdf\",\"continuous_mode\":true,\"resultType\":\"markdown\",\"options\":{\"auto_mode\":true,\"auto_mode_trigger_on_table_in_page\":true,\"auto_mode_trigger_on_image_in_page\":true},\"enriched\":true,\"enrichmentTimestamp\":\"2024-12-24T20:46:51.699Z\",\"processingTimestamp\":1735073212409}}", "documentId": "78fc46f1-6bfe-4a30-8ff7-f9f8cea59a3e", "embeddingMetadata": "{\"model\":\"text-embedding-3-large\",\"quality\":{\"l2Norm\":1.0000000446727766,\"meanComponent\":-0.0002524322614751954,\"stdDev\":0.018040430714662516}}", "filename": "2412.07189v1.pdf", "mimeType": "application/pdf", "model": "text-embedding-3-large", "nodeIndex": 3, "originalFormat": "application/pdf", "processingTime": 52775, "processingTimestamp": 1735073212409, "processor": "LlamaParseProcessor", "quality": "{\"l2Norm\":1.000000066123808,\"meanComponent\":-0.00024972260710856136,\"stdDev\":0.018040468813259443}", "semantic": "{\"type\":\"section\",\"name\":\"section_3\",\"complexity\":{\"cyclomaticComplexity\":1,\"nestingDepth\":0,\"dependencyCount\":0,\"referencedSymbols\":[]}}", "source": "{\"documentId\":\"proj_7a003d9e81dd45dcb08a9de26b3b6ee7_78fc46f1-6bfe-4a30-8ff7-f9f8cea59a3e\",\"mimeType\":\"application/pdf\",\"startLine\":0,\"endLine\":0,\"processingTimestamp\":1735073212409}", "sourceFileBucket": "prod-uploads", "sourceFilePath": "7a003d9e-81dd-45dc-b08a-9de26b3b6ee7/2024-12-24/78fb63e4-28fd-4f85-939e-2cf81db8d004_2412.07189v1.pdf", "text": "Document: 2412.07189v1.pdf\nType: application/pdf\nModified: 2024-12-24T20:46:51.699Z\nChunk: 4 of 9\n\n# DRL-PPO Framework\n\n## Enhanced Reliability\nRAG has also shown its effectiveness in enhancing the reliability of networks.

As experiments in [10] demonstrate, irrelevant content within the same topic can significantly impact LLM performance, decreasing generation accuracy by over 10%. This issue underscores RAG\u2019s difficulty in consistently providing comprehensive and accurate outputs. In the context of network optimization, such inaccurate retrieval can provide significantly negative influences on the decision-making process.\n\n3. **Challenges with Complex Queries**: RAG has limitations when handling complex queries that require synthesizing information from multiple sources or summarizing large documents. For instance, multi-document summarization experiments in [11] show that models including T5, BART, and PEGASUS achieve low ROUGE-L scores (below 0.2) on complex summarization tasks, indicating difficulty in generating cohesive summaries across related content. In the context of networking, lacking the capability to handle complex queries and summarize information can result in difficulties in obtaining a comprehensive overview of the network environment.\n\n## GraphRAG: Take One Step Further\nDespite previous enhancements, RAG\u2019s effectiveness in query-focused abstractive summarization over entire corpora remains limited. To address this, GraphRAG combines the strengths of RAG and knowledge graphs, overcoming each framework\u2019s limitations while enhancing its advantages.\n\n1. **Database Structure**: GraphRAG builds upon RAG\u2019s core features, adding a graph-structured database where entities and relationships are extracted by LLMs. Flat text chunks are mapped to entities and relationships within the knowledge graph, with vector embeddings facilitating retrieval. Furthermore, entities are organized into topic-centered communities through clustering algorithms, enabling retrieval from varying levels of abstraction and providing multi-angled insights into the database. In network applications, for example, such database structure can be obtained through the extraction of the interconnections among network devices, with entities representing the devices and relationships (edges) representing the connections.\n\n2. **Enhanced Retrieval Methods**: GraphRAG supports two synergistic retrieval modes: Local Search and Global Search. For Local Search, this method retrieves entity-specific information by traversing the graph\u2019s nodes (entities) and edges (relationships), capturing complex interdependencies to respond effectively to specific queries. For Global Search, Community-based retrieval uses summaries of topic-centered communities to answer broader queries. For example, considering a knowledge graph representing the network environment, the retrieval starts from the queried devices in the knowledge graph, then moves along their connections, and finally incorporates the explored information to identify the internet information (e.g., channel information, interconnections) around the queried devices.\n\nThe key characteristics of GraphRAG can be summarized in Figure 2. As a validation of GraphRAG\u2019s advantages, experiments in [12] comparing GraphRAG and vanilla RAG on various generation tasks demonstrated that GraphRAG improves answer comprehensiveness, diversity, and empowerment by approximately 30%, producing more contextually helpful responses. In networking optimization, GraphRAG offers distinct advantages, including:\n\n- **Enhanced Contextual Understanding**: GraphRAG leverages the inherent relationships between entities in a knowledge graph, enabling a deeper and more accurate understanding of context. It is able to assess the relevance of retrieved documents based on their relationships and connections, leading to more contextually appropriate retrieval. This characteristic of GraphRAG is particularly beneficial in networking applications.", "tokenCount": 1402, "transformConfig": "{\"mode\":\"default\",\"options\":{\"auto_mode\":true,\"continuous_mode\":true}}", "hybridScore": "5.29871273"}, "citation_uuid": -1}, {"url": "38c90c4b-bb06-4dc8-a3c8-3e998087cc44", "description": "", "snippets": ["Document: 2412.05838v1.pdf\nType: application/pdf\nModified: 2024-12-24T20:28:56.762Z\nChunk: 3 of 16\n\n# Multi-Agent RAG System\n\n## 2.3 Choice of LLM in RAG\n\nThe choice of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a crucial consideration in the design and implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. LLMs serve as the foundation for query generation and response synthesis, but their token limits and processing capabilities significantly impact the system\u2019s efficiency and scalability. LLMs can be broadly categorized into two types: local models and API-based models. Both categories have unique advantages and challenges, making the decision highly dependent on factors such as data sensitivity, computational resources, and scalability requirements.\n\n### Local LLMs\n\nLocal LLMs, such as Mistral, Zephyr, and Llama, operate within an organization\u2019s infrastructure, providing complete control over sensitive or proprietary data. This makes them particularly suitable for industries like healthcare and finance, where data privacy and regulatory compliance are critical. Local deployment ensures that no sensitive data leaves the premises, mitigating risks associated with data breaches. However, these models require substantial computational resources, including high-performance GPUs, for efficient operation, which can increase the cost and complexity of deployment.\n\n### API-Based LLMs\n\nAPI-based LLMs, such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT models and Google\u2019s Gemini family, are hosted on cloud platforms and eliminate the need for maintaining extensive infrastructure. They are easy to integrate, benefit from continuous updates, and provide high scalability, making them ideal for applications requiring dynamic workloads. Despite these advantages, API-based models introduce concerns regarding data privacy, as sensitive information must be transmitted to external servers for processing. Additionally, their token-based pricing models can lead to unpredictable costs for applications with heavy usage.\n\n### Token Constraints\n\nToken constraints further influence the choice of LLMs in RAG systems. Both local and API-based models impose limits on the amount of data that can be processed in a single query, necessitating the use of efficient data chunking and retrieval techniques.\n\n#### Table 1: Comparison of Local and API-Based LLMs\n\n| Model Type      | LLM Provider | LLM Model          | Context Window                     |\n|------------------|--------------|--------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Local LLMs       | Mistral      | Mistral 7B        | 4096 - 16K (Sliding Windows)      |\n|                  | Huggingface  | Zephyr             | 8192                               |\n|                  | Microsoft    | Phi-2             | 2048                               |\n|                  | Meta         | Llama 3           | 8192                               |\n| API-Based LLMs   | OpenAI       | GPT-4             | 128,000                            |\n|                  | OpenAI       | GPT-4 Turbo       | 128,000                            |\n|                  | OpenAI       | GPT-3.5 Turbo     | 16,385                             |\n|                  | Google       | Gemini 1.5 Flash   | 1,048,576                          |\n|                  | Google       | Gemini 1.5 Pro     | 2,097,152                          |\n\nThe selection of an LLM for RAG systems depends on a balance of priorities.

A potential solution is to provide the most relevant reference text, allowing for more precise validation of whether a requirement is being violated (Spoletini and Ferrari, 2024).

The basic principle behind RAG involves utilizing retrieval mechanisms to gather relevant data that can be incorporated into the generation process, thereby improving the contextual accuracy and relevance of the output generated by language models.\n\nThe RAG framework operates by combining two key components: a retrieval system and a generative model. The retrieval component searches for pertinent information from a database or knowledge base based on a given query. Once this relevant data is retrieved, it is then fed into a generative model, which synthesizes the retrieved information into coherent and contextually appropriate text. This approach allows for more informed responses as the generative model is not solely dependent on its training data but can also draw from real-time, context-specific information.\n\nOne of the significant applications of RAG is in enhancing the reliability of networks. For example, in a case study involving autonomous driving scenarios, RAG was used in conjunction with AI agents to provide real-time updates on road conditions and to optimize network configurations. The integration of RAG demonstrated substantial improvements in network reliability and performance by ensuring that the generative model had access to the most relevant and current data regarding the network environment.\n\nHowever, RAG does have its limitations. One notable challenge is its lack of contextual awareness, particularly when it comes to capturing interrelated entities or key data located in the middle of larger texts. This limitation can lead to significant drops in performance, especially in tasks requiring multi-document understanding. Moreover, RAG can sometimes retrieve irrelevant or partially relevant data, impacting the quality and accuracy of the generated output. For complex queries that require synthesizing information from multiple sources, RAG may struggle, which can hinder effective decision-making in scenarios such as network optimization.\n\nTo address some of these limitations, newer frameworks like GraphRAG have been developed. GraphRAG enhances RAG by incorporating a graph-structured database that organizes entities and their relationships, allowing for a more sophisticated retrieval method. This enables the framework to leverage contextual relationships and improve the comprehensiveness and relevance of retrieved information, particularly beneficial in applications like network community detection and optimization.\n\nIn summary, RAG is a pivotal framework in the field of generative modeling that significantly enhances the performance of language models by integrating external retrieval systems.", "user_utterance": "Could you explain what RAG stands for and the basic principle behind it?", "search_queries": ["what does RAG stand for?", "what is RAG in data science?", "RAG principles explained"], "search_results": [{"url": "45fdfb96-6610-4c65-bdea-7c705a8ce97e", "description": "", "snippets": ["Document: 2412.07189v1.pdf\nType: application/pdf\nModified: 2024-12-24T20:46:51.699Z\nChunk: 4 of 9\n\n# DRL-PPO Framework\n\n## Enhanced Reliability\nRAG has also shown its effectiveness in enhancing the reliability of networks. By enabling real-time, context-aware decision-making, RAG helps provide reliable information about the network environment. For example, the authors in [8] introduced a 6G AI agent based on the LangChain framework, incorporating RAG and GPT-4 Turbo. Its performance is assessed across three autonomous driving scenarios, demonstrating effectiveness in real-time road updates, network configuration for tailored requests, and D2D vehicle communication. Results confirm its ability to enhance network reliability and performance significantly.\n\n## RAG Limitations\nDespite RAG\u2019s advancements in enhancing generative model performance through retrieval, it has certain limitations:\n\n1. **Lack of Contextual Awareness**: RAG can struggle with capturing full contextual information, especially with interrelated entities across multiple document sections or crucial data embedded in the middle of text. Experiments in [9] show that when using GPT-3.5-Turbo for multi-document QA tasks, performance drops by over 20% if key information is positioned mid-context rather than at the beginning or end. This decline is more pronounced as the number of retrieved documents increases, highlighting RAG\u2019s limited contextual awareness. In the context of networking, this weakness in missing information located in the middle of the database can raise problems with inaccurate mapping of network information, such as the connection information among devices.\n\n2. **Incomplete Retrievals**: RAG may retrieve irrelevant or partially relevant data due to its lack of structured understanding of relationships between data points. As experiments in [10] demonstrate, irrelevant content within the same topic can significantly impact LLM performance, decreasing generation accuracy by over 10%. This issue underscores RAG\u2019s difficulty in consistently providing comprehensive and accurate outputs. In the context of network optimization, such inaccurate retrieval can provide significantly negative influences on the decision-making process.\n\n3. **Challenges with Complex Queries**: RAG has limitations when handling complex queries that require synthesizing information from multiple sources or summarizing large documents. For instance, multi-document summarization experiments in [11] show that models including T5, BART, and PEGASUS achieve low ROUGE-L scores (below 0.2) on complex summarization tasks, indicating difficulty in generating cohesive summaries across related content. In the context of networking, lacking the capability to handle complex queries and summarize information can result in difficulties in obtaining a comprehensive overview of the network environment.\n\n## GraphRAG: Take One Step Further\nDespite previous enhancements, RAG\u2019s effectiveness in query-focused abstractive summarization over entire corpora remains limited. To address this, GraphRAG combines the strengths of RAG and knowledge graphs, overcoming each framework\u2019s limitations while enhancing its advantages.\n\n1. **Database Structure**: GraphRAG builds upon RAG\u2019s core features, adding a graph-structured database where entities and relationships are extracted by LLMs. Flat text chunks are mapped to entities and relationships within the knowledge graph, with vector embeddings facilitating retrieval. Furthermore, entities are organized into topic-centered communities through clustering algorithms, enabling retrieval from varying levels of abstraction and providing multi-angled insights into the database. In network applications, for example, such database structure can be obtained through the extraction of the interconnections among network devices, with entities representing the devices and relationships (edges) representing the connections.\n\n2. **Enhanced Retrieval Methods**: GraphRAG supports two synergistic retrieval modes: Local Search and Global Search. For Local Search, this method retrieves entity-specific information by traversing the graph\u2019s nodes (entities) and edges (relationships), capturing complex interdependencies to respond effectively to specific queries. For Global Search, Community-based retrieval uses summaries of topic-centered communities to answer broader queries. For example, considering a knowledge graph representing the network environment, the retrieval starts from the queried devices in the knowledge graph, then moves along their connections, and finally incorporates the explored information to identify the internet information (e.g., channel information, interconnections) around the queried devices.\n\nThe key characteristics of GraphRAG can be summarized in Figure 2. As a validation of GraphRAG\u2019s advantages, experiments in [12] comparing GraphRAG and vanilla RAG on various generation tasks demonstrated that GraphRAG improves answer comprehensiveness, diversity, and empowerment by approximately 30%, producing more contextually helpful responses.

By enabling real-time, context-aware decision-making, RAG helps provide reliable information about the network environment. For example, the authors in [8] introduced a 6G AI agent based on the LangChain framework, incorporating RAG and GPT-4 Turbo. Its performance is assessed across three autonomous driving scenarios, demonstrating effectiveness in real-time road updates, network configuration for tailored requests, and D2D vehicle communication.

Motivation\nThe rapid evolution of next-generation wireless networks introduces unprecedented challenges in terms of scalability, adaptability, and complexity in communication environments. As networks become more intricate, the existing modeling tools for spectrum maps have encountered several limitations. The growing complexity raised challenges toward clear representation of network topology and effective retrieval of network information, which demands a shift towards more intelligent and context-aware modeling techniques that can effectively integrate and utilize vast amounts of data. Traditional channel modeling methods, such as fitted path loss models, struggle to capture the nuanced dynamics of these systems. Traditional AI methods, while powerful, are often limited by their inability to reason over structured knowledge or dynamically adapt to rapidly changing network conditions. They primarily rely on predefined rules and lack the flexibility required to handle the multifaceted relationships inherent in modern wireless communication systems.\n\nTo address these limitations, we propose a novel framework based on GraphRAG that leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs and the structural representation power of knowledge graphs. Compared to the traditional modeling approaches for spectrum maps, which often lack a clear and structured representation of data, GraphRAG\u2019s knowledge graph effectively maps the interconnections between devices within the spectrum map. This approach not only outperforms traditional AI methods in terms of contextual awareness and scalability but also offers a more structured, data-driven solution that can dynamically evolve with the network\u2019s needs.\n\n### B. Basic Validation\nIn our experiments, we construct the vanilla RAG framework following the experiment settings in previous studies. The RAG framework is constructed using LangChain and OpenAI APIs. For the GraphRAG framework, we utilize Microsoft\u2019s implementation of GraphRAG, bypassing LangChain to create the knowledge database.

AI-driven question-answering (QA) systems can actively manage uncertainty in cybersecurity problem-solving, offering interactive, inquiry-based learning experiences. Large language models (LLMs) have gained prominence in AI-driven QA systems, offering advanced language understanding and user engagement. However, they face challenges like hallucinations and limited domain-specific knowledge, which reduce their reliability in educational settings. To address these challenges, we propose CyberRAG, an ontology-aware retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach for developing a reliable and safe QA system in cybersecurity education. CyberRAG employs a two-step approach: first, it augments the domain-specific knowledge by retrieving validated cybersecurity documents from a knowledge base to enhance the relevance and accuracy of the response. Second, it mitigates hallucinations and misuse by integrating a knowledge graph ontology to validate the final answer. Experiments on publicly available cybersecurity datasets show that CyberRAG delivers accurate, reliable responses aligned with domain knowledge, demonstrating the potential of AI tools to enhance education.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe use of AI in education has the potential to transform the way science and technology courses are taught. In scientific learning, students are expected to engage in problem-solving and exploration, yet traditional classroom methods often focus on the passive acquisition of established knowledge. This approach limits opportunities for students to experience the process of knowledge creation, leading to lower cognitive engagement. Cybersecurity is a problem-based learning domain where students must master complex tools, develop defense techniques, and uncover new threats, which necessitates a re-imagination of traditional education practices.\n\nPrior research highlights that managing uncertainty is a crucial component of the learning process, as students often struggle with acquiring new skills, applying diverse methodologies, and forming new understandings. Educators can effectively manage this uncertainty by increasing it through the introduction of authentic, ambiguous challenges to stimulate critical thinking, encouraging deeper exploration and problem-solving, and reducing it by identifying optimal solutions to help students integrate new insights with existing knowledge.\n\nAlthough the RAG approach helps reduce hallucinations and address domain knowledge issues to some extent, the reliability of LLM-generated answers remains a concern for achieving educational goals. Students may ask questions that fall outside the scope of the augmented cybersecurity knowledge base. In such cases, LLMs rely on their own parametric knowledge to generate responses, which can expose the QA system to risks of misinformation or misuse. In an educational setting, it is also crucial to prevent students from manipulating the AI system for unintended purposes.

AI-driven question-answering (QA) systems can actively manage uncertainty in cybersecurity problem-solving, offering interactive, inquiry-based learning experiences. Large language models (LLMs) have gained prominence in AI-driven QA systems, offering advanced language understanding and user engagement. However, they face challenges like hallucinations and limited domain-specific knowledge, which reduce their reliability in educational settings. To address these challenges, we propose CyberRAG, an ontology-aware retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach for developing a reliable and safe QA system in cybersecurity education. CyberRAG employs a two-step approach: first, it augments the domain-specific knowledge by retrieving validated cybersecurity documents from a knowledge base to enhance the relevance and accuracy of the response. Second, it mitigates hallucinations and misuse by integrating a knowledge graph ontology to validate the final answer. Experiments on publicly available cybersecurity datasets show that CyberRAG delivers accurate, reliable responses aligned with domain knowledge, demonstrating the potential of AI tools to enhance education.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe use of AI in education has the potential to transform the way science and technology courses are taught. In scientific learning, students are expected to engage in problem-solving and exploration, yet traditional classroom methods often focus on the passive acquisition of established knowledge. This approach limits opportunities for students to experience the process of knowledge creation, leading to lower cognitive engagement. Cybersecurity is a problem-based learning domain where students must master complex tools, develop defense techniques, and uncover new threats, which necessitates a re-imagination of traditional education practices.\n\nPrior research highlights that managing uncertainty is a crucial component of the learning process, as students often struggle with acquiring new skills, applying diverse methodologies, and forming new understandings. Educators can effectively manage this uncertainty by increasing it through the introduction of authentic, ambiguous challenges to stimulate critical thinking, encouraging deeper exploration and problem-solving, and reducing it by identifying optimal solutions to help students integrate new insights with existing knowledge.\n\nAlthough the RAG approach helps reduce hallucinations and address domain knowledge issues to some extent, the reliability of LLM-generated answers remains a concern for achieving educational goals. Students may ask questions that fall outside the scope of the augmented cybersecurity knowledge base. In such cases, LLMs rely on their own parametric knowledge to generate responses, which can expose the QA system to risks of misinformation or misuse. In an educational setting, it is also crucial to prevent students from manipulating the AI system for unintended purposes.

While LLMs are highly capable, they often rely on static, pre-trained datasets, limiting their ability to integrate dynamic or private data. Traditional RAG systems typically use a single-agent architecture to handle query generation, data retrieval, and response synthesis. However, this approach becomes inefficient when dealing with diverse data sources, such as relational databases, document stores, and graph databases, often leading to performance bottlenecks and reduced accuracy.\n\nThis paper proposes a Multi-Agent RAG system to address these limitations. Specialized agents, each optimized for a specific data source, handle query generation for relational, NoSQL, and document-based systems.

This system allows organizations to categorize and communicate performance metrics, risks, and progress in a straightforward manner, facilitating effective decision-making and resource allocation.\n\nIn the RAG framework:\n- **Red** indicates that there are significant issues that require immediate attention or intervention. This status suggests that a project is at risk of failing to meet its objectives unless corrective action is taken.\n- **Amber** signifies that there are some concerns or potential risks that could impact performance, but they are not currently critical. This status serves as a warning that vigilance is required, and adjustments may be necessary to steer the project back on track.\n- **Green** reflects that everything is progressing well, with no significant issues currently impacting the project. It indicates that the project is on target to achieve its goals within the planned timeline and budget.\n\nThe application of RAG status in nonprofit performance management serves several important functions:\n1. **Communication**: By using the RAG system, nonprofits can quickly communicate the status of various initiatives to stakeholders, including board members, donors, and team members. This transparency fosters trust and accountability within the organization.\n2. **Prioritization**: The color-coded nature of RAG allows organizations to prioritize issues based on their urgency and severity. Nonprofits can allocate resources more effectively, addressing red-status projects first to mitigate risks.\n3. **Monitoring**: RAG statuses can be integrated into regular reporting mechanisms, enabling nonprofits to monitor project health over time and make data-driven adjustments to strategies and operations.\n\nIn practice, RAG assessments are often conducted on a periodic basis, where team leaders or project managers evaluate the performance and risks of their initiatives against established objectives. They may utilize performance metrics, stakeholder feedback, and other data sources to determine the appropriate RAG status.\n\nOverall, the RAG status is a crucial tool for nonprofits, aiding in the management of performance and risk while fostering a culture of responsiveness and proactive problem-solving within the organization.", "user_utterance": "I apologize for any confusion, but I am specifically interested in the RAG status that is used within nonprofit organizations to assess and report on performance and risks.

In these domains, maintaining consistency, adhering to regulatory frameworks, minimizing errors, and meeting critical expectations are essential for the reliable functioning of systems. The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) highlights their immense potential, yet there remains considerable scope for improvement in retrieving relevant information and enhancing reasoning capabilities. This study demonstrates that integrating a robust Graph-RAG framework with advanced prompt engineering techniques, such as Chain of Thought and Tree of Thought, can significantly enhance performance. Compared to baseline RAG methods and simple prompting strategies, this approach delivers more accurate and context-aware results.

Examples\n\nThe following are examples of questions from the test dataset along with their answers according to the models tested:\n\n1) **Question:** Solve 312*s + 276*s - 661*s + 952 = -362 for s.\n**Real Answer:** 18\n**NL RAG Answer:** The final answer is {1}.\n**FL RAG Answer:** The final answer is {18}.\n\n2) **Question:** In base 10, what is -15 - -839090?\n**Real Answer:** 839075\n**NL RAG Answer:** The final answer is {-839075}.\n**FL RAG Answer:** Therefore, the final answer is {839075}.\n\n3) **Question:** What is the difference between -988.36 and -73357.6?\n**Real Answer:** 72369.24\n**NL RAG Answer:** The final answer is {72369.24}.\n**FL RAG Answer:** It seems like you might have entered a statement instead of a math problem. Could you please provide the math problem you would like me to solve?\n\n4) **Question:** Find the second derivative of 10490087*j*z**2 - 4460*j - 179*z wrt z.\n**Real Answer:** 20980174*j\n**NL RAG Answer:** The final answer is ({2 cdot 10490087 cdot j}).\n**FL RAG Answer:** The final answer is {20980174 * j}.\n\n5) **Question:** Suppose 27*t = 43 + 11. Let f be (t + (-111)/(-12))/((-2)/(-8)). What is the highest common divisor of f and 15?\n**Real Answer:** 15\n**NL RAG Answer:** Thus, the final answer is {15}.\n**FL RAG Answer:** The final answer is {3}.\n\nWe can see in examples 1 and 5 instances where the NL RAG was simply more accurate. In example 4 we see an instance where both answered correctly, but the NL RAG didn\u2019t quite give a final answer. In example 2 we see a trick question where the NL RAG was tricked but the FL RAG wasn\u2019t, probably due to the extra layer of formalization. In example 3 we see an instance where the NL RAG answered correctly, but the FL RAG didn\u2019t answer at all, probably an issue with the translation to FL.\n\n# V. CONCLUSION\n\nThis study investigated the integration of formal mathematical language, specifically Lean code, into RAGs to enhance the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs. By constructing a knowledge corpus composed of formalized mathematical statements and proofs, and translating NL queries into formal representations, we aimed to improve LLM performance in advanced logical reasoning tasks. The evaluation conducted using the Mathematics Dataset developed by Google [Saxton et al., 2019] demonstrated that the FL RAG achieved an average answer correctness of 73%, outperforming the NL RAG system, which achieved 54%. This significant improvement suggests that incorporating FL into the RAG process can yield advantages over conventional NL-based approaches in mathematical problem-solving. Notably, the knowledge corpus used in the FL RAG consisted of the same NL statements from the NL RAG translated into Lean. Therefore, even with potential mistakes and inaccuracies in the translation process\u2014both when translating the query in real time and in creating the FL knowledge corpus\u2014these improvements were achieved.\n\n# VI. DISCUSSION\n\nWhile we can only speculate about the underlying reasons for the performance boost observed with the FL configuration, several factors may contribute to this improvement. One possible reason is the additional processing involved in the translation step.

Examples\n\nThe following are examples of questions from the test dataset along with their answers according to the models tested:\n\n1) **Question:** Solve 312*s + 276*s - 661*s + 952 = -362 for s.\n**Real Answer:** 18\n**NL RAG Answer:** The final answer is {1}.\n**FL RAG Answer:** The final answer is {18}.\n\n2) **Question:** In base 10, what is -15 - -839090?\n**Real Answer:** 839075\n**NL RAG Answer:** The final answer is {-839075}.\n**FL RAG Answer:** Therefore, the final answer is {839075}.\n\n3) **Question:** What is the difference between -988.36 and -73357.6?\n**Real Answer:** 72369.24\n**NL RAG Answer:** The final answer is {72369.24}.\n**FL RAG Answer:** It seems like you might have entered a statement instead of a math problem. Could you please provide the math problem you would like me to solve?\n\n4) **Question:** Find the second derivative of 10490087*j*z**2 - 4460*j - 179*z wrt z.\n**Real Answer:** 20980174*j\n**NL RAG Answer:** The final answer is ({2 cdot 10490087 cdot j}).\n**FL RAG Answer:** The final answer is {20980174 * j}.\n\n5) **Question:** Suppose 27*t = 43 + 11. Let f be (t + (-111)/(-12))/((-2)/(-8)). What is the highest common divisor of f and 15?\n**Real Answer:** 15\n**NL RAG Answer:** Thus, the final answer is {15}.\n**FL RAG Answer:** The final answer is {3}.\n\nWe can see in examples 1 and 5 instances where the NL RAG was simply more accurate. In example 4 we see an instance where both answered correctly, but the NL RAG didn\u2019t quite give a final answer. In example 2 we see a trick question where the NL RAG was tricked but the FL RAG wasn\u2019t, probably due to the extra layer of formalization. In example 3 we see an instance where the NL RAG answered correctly, but the FL RAG didn\u2019t answer at all, probably an issue with the translation to FL.\n\n# V. CONCLUSION\n\nThis study investigated the integration of formal mathematical language, specifically Lean code, into RAGs to enhance the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs. By constructing a knowledge corpus composed of formalized mathematical statements and proofs, and translating NL queries into formal representations, we aimed to improve LLM performance in advanced logical reasoning tasks. The evaluation conducted using the Mathematics Dataset developed by Google [Saxton et al., 2019] demonstrated that the FL RAG achieved an average answer correctness of 73%, outperforming the NL RAG system, which achieved 54%. This significant improvement suggests that incorporating FL into the RAG process can yield advantages over conventional NL-based approaches in mathematical problem-solving. Notably, the knowledge corpus used in the FL RAG consisted of the same NL statements from the NL RAG translated into Lean. Therefore, even with potential mistakes and inaccuracies in the translation process\u2014both when translating the query in real time and in creating the FL knowledge corpus\u2014these improvements were achieved.\n\n# VI. DISCUSSION\n\nWhile we can only speculate about the underlying reasons for the performance boost observed with the FL configuration, several factors may contribute to this improvement. One possible reason is the additional processing involved in the translation step. In many instances, the Lean translator was observed to attempt to solve the questions by providing a solution as part of the statement (sometimes incorrectly). This could inadvertently provide the LLM with more context or hints toward the correct answer.\n\nAnother potential factor is that the use of Lean in querying the LLM may help it access more mathematically accurate portions of its training data.

BACKGROUND\n\n### A. Retrieval-Augmented Language Models\n\nRAG is a sophisticated framework designed to enhance language models by coupling them with external retrieval systems, addressing limitations inherent in static, solely parameter-based language models. RAG integrates a dual-component architecture where a retriever dynamically searches a structured external corpus for relevant information based on the input query, and a generator LLM uses the retrieved content as context to generate accurate and contextually enriched responses [Gao et al., 2023, Mialon et al., 2023]. This setup mitigates common issues such as hallucinations and factual inaccuracies in language models by grounding generated text in real-world, verified information. In practice, RAG systems employ dense vector embeddings to ensure retrieval relevance, capturing semantic relationships within documents beyond mere keyword matching. The retrieved information is subsequently fed into the generator, allowing it to synthesize data with pre-existing knowledge for enhanced coherence and contextual accuracy.\n\nRAGs can employ two main types of retrieval mechanisms: dense and sparse [Mialon et al., 2023]. Sparse retrievers rely on bag-of-words representations, excelling at finding documents with high term overlap to the query, while dense retrievers utilize neural network embeddings to capture semantic similarities, enhancing the model's comprehension of related concepts. By appending retrieved documents directly to the model\u2019s context, these retrievers allow the language model to ground its responses in a broader context, thereby increasing accuracy and factual consistency across complex tasks.\n\nThe success of retrieval-augmented models in various domains has catalyzed interest in their application to more demanding reasoning tasks. A great representative of such tasks is the construction and verification of mathematical proofs, which requires solving problems step-by-step, and generating precise mathematical statements. Recent approaches, such as chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting [Lewkowycz et al., 2022] combined with retrieval, highlight the potential for retrieval-augmented models to provide sequential reasoning support. These models can generate reasoning paths interspersed with retrieval steps to guide complex problem-solving processes, such as multi-step question answering, enabling models to leverage external information dynamically at each reasoning stage.\n\n### B. Autoformalization\n\nAutoformalization is the process of translating informal mathematical expressions, typically written in natural language (NL) or standard mathematical notation, into formalized, machine-readable language that theorem provers and proof assistants (such as Lean) can interpret and verify [Wu et al. (2022)]. This transformation process is complex, requiring the formal system to not only translate symbols accurately but also to grasp the semantic and logical nuances of mathematical language. The goal of autoformalization is to enable computers to autonomously produce valid formal statements from human-readable text, thereby reducing the time and expertise needed to encode informal statements manually into formal systems like Lean.\n\nLLMs can perform autoformalization by using Few-shot prompting. Few-shot prompting is a strategy that provides LLMs with small sets of example pairs, illustrating how informal language maps to formalized statements. These examples help guide the model in recognizing the patterns and syntactic structures unique to formal mathematical language. The LLM can then apply this learned structure to new informal inputs, generating outputs that are syntactically and semantically aligned with formal systems\u2019 requirements. This approach leverages the model's capacity to generalize from limited examples, enabling it to interpret complex mathematical statements and produce formal representations accurately.\n\nThe formalization process requires the LLM to maintain logical coherence across multi-step arguments and correctly interpret mathematical abstractions\u2014tasks that are beyond the capabilities of many general-purpose language models. However, LLMs that are fine-tuned with carefully curated formalization examples show promising results, achieving increasingly accurate interpretations of informal mathematical language. This advancement has significant implications for fields such as formal verification and automated reasoning [Wu et al., 2022].\n\nThe recent advancements in autoformalization and automated theorem proving build upon foundational datasets and innovative training techniques to bridge the gap between NL and formal mathematical systems.

These features are akin to the small set of concepts a person might have in mind when reasoning about a situation. We refer to such features as Noun-Phrases, and our Noun-Phrase Dominance Model that predates the OpenAI and Anthropic studies posited that LLMs self-organize around such noun phrases during training [13].\n\n**Long Context RAG**\nRecently, LLMs have greatly increased their context window, allowing a very large amount of text to be sent along with the prompt. Before the advent of long-context language models, RAG was a key solution for overcoming the limitations of small context window sizes. Some researchers have examined if a sufficiently large context window could effectively replace RAG altogether. Databricks examined the effects of increased context size on various modern LLMs. The net result was that no LLM, regardless of the amount of data sent to it, was able to exceed greater than 80% accuracy on various QA benchmarks [6].\n\n**Faithfulness and Correctness**\nTwo terms that are important to understand as it relates to evaluating RAG and LLMs are Faithfulness and Correctness. Faithfulness evaluates whether the generated output accurately reflects the information contained in the retrieved documents [14]. A response is considered faithful if it does not introduce information that is absent from the retrieved sources, and adheres closely to the input data. This criterion measures how consistently the LLM response aligns with the retrieved content. A perfect faithfulness score means there is no \"hallucination\" caused by deviation from the content (such as by introducing new facts or interpretations). In other words, a faithful response directly reflects the content of the retrieved documents, with all statements fully supported by the retrieved data.\n\nCorrectness, on the other hand, assesses the factual accuracy of the output within a broader context [14]. A response is deemed correct if it aligns with established facts, even when those facts are not explicitly present in the retrieved documents. Correctness measures how well the generated answer matches verified external knowledge. For instance, a correct response is factually accurate based on real-world information, even if some of that information originates from the model\u2019s parametric knowledge rather than the retrieved (non-parametric) sources. Faithfulness ensures that the response stays true to the retrieved information, while correctness ensures that the response is factually accurate, regardless of its source.\n\n**Explanation of Acurai Terms**\nWe use the terms \"accurate\" and \"faithful\" herein interchangeably. For our primary use case (enterprise chatbots), the goal is to provide answers that are faithful to the information provided. For example, if an enterprise customer is a car company, they want their chatbot to be faithful to the documents provided to the chatbot, which may say their cars are \"the best\". This faithful answer may not be an objectively quantifiable answer; and perhaps even according to a third party, this company\u2019s cars are not, in fact, \"the best\". In many chatbots, correctness can be ambiguous or debatable, depending on the topic and question asked (\"Who is the greatest opera singer of all time?\"), whereas faithfulness can always be measured in concrete terms.\n\nIn a RAG-based chatbot, we refer to hallucinations as referring to any deviation from the provided context. Importantly, LLMs can still hallucinate even when clearly written facts are sent along with the query. For example, ChatGPT-3.5 Turbo was provided the following clearly written statements about calcium: \"Calcium is a sliver-grey metal. Calcium melts at 840\u00b0C. Calcium boils at 1484\u00b0C to produce monatomic gas. ...\" Remarkably, the LLM stated that all these properties belonged to magnesium when given the following instruction: \"Extract all facts about magnesium from the following passages.\" [15] The calcium statements could not be more clearly written. The prompt also clearly asks about magnesium. Nevertheless, the LLM treated magnesium as if it is the same thing as calcium. Acurai\u2019s Noun-Phrase Dominance Model says that all hallucinations occur when the LLM mistakes two distinct Noun-Phrases as being the same thing. More specifically, the LLM does so when the distinct noun phrases are semantically similar, such as is the case with calcium and magnesium [16]."], "title": "", "meta": {"score": 4.18780899, "chunkIndex": 2, "context": "{\"metadata\":{\"filename\":\"2412.05223v1.pdf\",\"lastModified\":\"2024-12-24T20:29:08.349Z\",\"importance\":1,\"contextualRelevance\":1,\"file_path\":\"/tmp/llama_parse_1735072142721_2412.05223v1.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"llama_parse_1735072142721_2412.05223v1.pdf\",\"continuous_mode\":true,\"resultType\":\"markdown\",\"options\":{\"auto_mode\":true,\"auto_mode_trigger_on_table_in_page\":true,\"auto_mode_trigger_on_image_in_page\":true},\"enriched\":true,\"enrichmentTimestamp\":\"2024-12-24T20:29:08.349Z\",\"processingTimestamp\":1735072149236}}", "documentId": "b26a8577-1b29-4b7e-bc66-8356fd2e4df7", "embeddingMetadata": "{\"model\":\"text-embedding-3-large\",\"quality\":{\"l2Norm\":1.0000000595116685,\"meanComponent\":-0.00040061394320540394,\"stdDev\":0.01803774876603008}}", "filename": "2412.05223v1.pdf", "mimeType": "application/pdf", "model": "text-embedding-3-large", "nodeIndex": 2, "originalFormat": "application/pdf", "processingTime": 6515, "processingTimestamp": 1735072149236, "processor": "LlamaParseProcessor", "quality": "{\"l2Norm\":1.0000000196273633,\"meanComponent\":-0.0003968449089041993,\"stdDev\":0.018037831361608882}", "semantic": "{\"type\":\"section\",\"name\":\"section_2\",\"complexity\":{\"cyclomaticComplexity\":1,\"nestingDepth\":0,\"dependencyCount\":0,\"referencedSymbols\":[]}}", "source": "{\"documentId\":\"proj_7a003d9e81dd45dcb08a9de26b3b6ee7_b26a8577-1b29-4b7e-bc66-8356fd2e4df7\",\"mimeType\":\"application/pdf\",\"startLine\":0,\"endLine\":0,\"processingTimestamp\":1735072149236}", "sourceFileBucket": "prod-uploads", "sourceFilePath": "7a003d9e-81dd-45dc-b08a-9de26b3b6ee7/2024-12-24/77bcd1dd-0b5c-4a14-8122-c86134716d10_2412.05223v1.pdf", "text": "Document: 2412.05223v1.pdf\nType: application/pdf\nModified: 2024-12-24T20:29:08.349Z\nChunk: 3 of 12\n\n**CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT:**\n\nA handful of \"features\" in their neural networks that are important to producing any given output.

INTRODUCTION\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, but they still face significant challenges, particularly in generating accurate and reliable information. One of the key issues is their tendency to produce hallucinated or incorrect responses. This has led to the use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAGs) [Gao et al., 2023, Mialon et al., 2023] in an effort to overcome such challenges, since RAGs allow the models to rely on verified external sources of information, which can offer increased accuracy to the generated data and combat hallucinations. However, RAGs still fail to ground LLMs when generating solutions to logical questions, and LLMs still fall short when attempting tasks that require the use of general reasoning skills. This manifests especially when it comes to mathematical reasoning.\n\nOne key issue is the difficulty LLMs face in achieving semantic understanding and contextual reasoning in mathematical language, often leading to incorrect or incomplete formalization of mathematical concepts [Ying et al., 2024]. This gap arises because mathematical language requires a depth of concept comprehension that is challenging to encode in token-based LLM frameworks [Gao et al., 2024]. LLMs also struggle with long-term dependencies inherent in mathematical reasoning, as solutions to mathematical problems often rely on concepts and steps from earlier sections of a text [Lin et al., 2024]. Given the models' limited memory, they have difficulty establishing continuity across extended logical arguments.

Integrating RAG into an organization's existing performance measurement frameworks can significantly enhance decision-making and accountability processes.\n\nTo effectively integrate RAG, organizations must first assess their current performance measurement systems to identify gaps that RAG can fill. RAG's baseline implementation utilizes dense retrieval techniques that involve embedding documents into dense vector representations, allowing for efficient content retrieval when queries are made. This step involves aligning the retrieved content with the specific needs of the organization, ensuring that responses provided by the generative model are contextually relevant (Lewis et al., 2020). Thus, an initial adjustment may include updating the organization's data management practices to ensure that relevant documents are accurately indexed and retrievable.\n\nMoreover, the integration process may require adjustments in the prompt engineering techniques used alongside RAG. Advanced strategies such as Chain of Thought and Tree of Thought can be employed to improve the reasoning capabilities of the system. These methods involve breaking down requirements into logical components and analyzing them independently, then consolidating these analyses to ensure comprehensive evaluations. This multi-agent reasoning framework enhances the accuracy of the results provided by RAG, making it essential for organizations to adapt their operational processes to leverage these advanced prompting techniques effectively (Masoudifard et al.).\n\nHowever, implementing RAG does present challenges. Organizations may face increased complexity and costs associated with deploying these advanced systems. It is crucial to ensure that the input data is complete and accurate, as the effectiveness of RAG heavily relies on high-quality data (Masoudifard et al.). Consequently, organizations may need to invest in data validation processes and training for personnel to manage these new systems effectively.\n\nIn summary, for the successful integration of RAG into existing performance measurement frameworks, organizations must update data management practices, employ advanced prompt engineering techniques, and address potential complexities in implementation. These steps will enhance the reliability and performance of the system, ultimately contributing to more informed decision-making and improved outcomes.", "user_utterance": "Can you explain how the RAG system is typically integrated with an organization's existing performance measurement frameworks and what adjustments might be necessary for effective implementation?", "search_queries": ["what is RAG system in performance measurement", "how is RAG integrated with performance measurement frameworks", "RAG system implementation in organizations"], "search_results": [{"url": "3056b910-da79-4670-b527-96063bce23eb", "description": "", "snippets": ["Document: 2412.08593v1.pdf\nType: application/pdf\nModified: 2024-12-24T20:23:57.624Z\nChunk: 16 of 32\n\nThe final step synthesizes the component-level analyses to deliver an overall assessment. This includes determining whether the requirement conforms to or violates the reference text, supported by a clear rationale that highlights the key areas of alignment, inconsistencies, or conflicts. This step-by-step logical approach, encoded into the prompts, ensures a rigorous evaluation while maintaining clarity and focus on critical details.\n\n- **Tree-of-Thought Prompt:** ToT prompting applies a multi-agent reasoning framework to assess the alignment between a requirement and its reference text. The process begins with three independent agents breaking down the requirement and reference text into logical components: Purpose, Action, and Conditions/Constraints. Each agent provides an individual analysis, ensuring diverse perspectives without cross-influence. A final arbiter consolidates their outputs, selecting the most accurate and comprehensive breakdown.\n\nIn the second step, the agents analyze the consolidated breakdown to determine how well each component aligns, partially aligns, or conflicts between the requirement and the reference text. Each agent provides detailed reasoning for their evaluation, emphasizing different aspects of alignment. The arbiter then synthesizes these analyses, identifying the strongest reasoning to produce a consolidated evaluation for each component.\n\nIn the final step, the agents collectively assess whether the requirement overall \u201cConforms\u201d or \u201cViolates\u201d the reference text. Their evaluations consider all components\u2014Purpose Alignment, Action Consistency, and Conditions/Constraints Alignment\u2014and are supported by detailed rationales. The arbiter reviews the agents\u2019 assessments to produce a final decision, either adopting one perspective or synthesizing them for a balanced conclusion. This iterative, multi-agent approach ensures a robust and comprehensive evaluation of alignment and conformance.\n\n### 5 Evaluation\nIn this section, we begin by evaluating the search capabilities of Graph-RAG in comparison to the baseline RAG. Subsequently, we assess its reasoning ability to determine the alignment between the retrieved reference content and the given requirement.\n\nThis baseline RAG implementation combines dense retrieval with a generative language model to deliver context-aware answers (Lewis et al., 2020). It begins by embedding documents into dense vector representations using a pre-trained Sentence-Transformer model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2). These embeddings enable efficient retrieval of relevant content. When a query is input, the system computes its embedding and identifies the most similar documents from the indexed collection.

This includes determining whether the requirement conforms to or violates the reference text, supported by a clear rationale that highlights the key areas of alignment, inconsistencies, or conflicts. This step-by-step logical approach, encoded into the prompts, ensures a rigorous evaluation while maintaining clarity and focus on critical details.\n\n- **Tree-of-Thought Prompt:** ToT prompting applies a multi-agent reasoning framework to assess the alignment between a requirement and its reference text. The process begins with three independent agents breaking down the requirement and reference text into logical components: Purpose, Action, and Conditions/Constraints. Each agent provides an individual analysis, ensuring diverse perspectives without cross-influence. A final arbiter consolidates their outputs, selecting the most accurate and comprehensive breakdown.\n\nIn the second step, the agents analyze the consolidated breakdown to determine how well each component aligns, partially aligns, or conflicts between the requirement and the reference text. Each agent provides detailed reasoning for their evaluation, emphasizing different aspects of alignment. The arbiter then synthesizes these analyses, identifying the strongest reasoning to produce a consolidated evaluation for each component.\n\nIn the final step, the agents collectively assess whether the requirement overall \u201cConforms\u201d or \u201cViolates\u201d the reference text. Their evaluations consider all components\u2014Purpose Alignment, Action Consistency, and Conditions/Constraints Alignment\u2014and are supported by detailed rationales. The arbiter reviews the agents\u2019 assessments to produce a final decision, either adopting one perspective or synthesizing them for a balanced conclusion. This iterative, multi-agent approach ensures a robust and comprehensive evaluation of alignment and conformance.\n\n### 5 Evaluation\nIn this section, we begin by evaluating the search capabilities of Graph-RAG in comparison to the baseline RAG. Subsequently, we assess its reasoning ability to determine the alignment between the retrieved reference content and the given requirement.\n\nThis baseline RAG implementation combines dense retrieval with a generative language model to deliver context-aware answers (Lewis et al., 2020). It begins by embedding documents into dense vector representations using a pre-trained Sentence-Transformer model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2). These embeddings enable efficient retrieval of relevant content. When a query is input, the system computes its embedding and identifies the most similar documents from the indexed collection. The retrieved documents are then formatted into a prompt, providing context for the generative model (GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini) to answer the query. This approach ensures that responses are informed by the retrieved context, making it effective for tasks requiring direct access to relevant information. However, it does not account for complex relationships or structured dependencies between entities, serving as a baseline for comparison with more advanced systems like Graph-RAG.", "tokenCount": 820, "transformConfig": "{\"mode\":\"default\",\"options\":{\"auto_mode\":true,\"continuous_mode\":true}}", "hybridScore": "5.34427404"}, "citation_uuid": -1}, {"url": "88c90bd6-fc24-400e-9fe0-0f522eec2e63", "description": "", "snippets": ["Document: 2412.08593v1.pdf\nType: application/pdf\nModified: 2024-12-24T20:23:57.624Z\nChunk: 1 of 32\n\n# Leveraging Graph-RAG and Prompt Engineering to Enhance LLM-Based Automated Requirement Traceability and Compliance Checks\n\n**Arsalan Masoudifard\u00b9*, Mohammad Mowlavi Sorond\u00b9, Moein Madadi\u00b9, Mohammad Sabokrou\u00b2, Elahe Habibi\u00b9**\n\u00b9Department of Computer Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran.\n\u00b2Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology, Okinawa, Japan.\n\n*Corresponding author(s).

By enabling real-time, context-aware decision-making, RAG helps provide reliable information about the network environment. For example, the authors in [8] introduced a 6G AI agent based on the LangChain framework, incorporating RAG and GPT-4 Turbo. Its performance is assessed across three autonomous driving scenarios, demonstrating effectiveness in real-time road updates, network configuration for tailored requests, and D2D vehicle communication. Results confirm its ability to enhance network reliability and performance significantly.\n\n## RAG Limitations\nDespite RAG\u2019s advancements in enhancing generative model performance through retrieval, it has certain limitations:\n\n1. **Lack of Contextual Awareness**: RAG can struggle with capturing full contextual information, especially with interrelated entities across multiple document sections or crucial data embedded in the middle of text. Experiments in [9] show that when using GPT-3.5-Turbo for multi-document QA tasks, performance drops by over 20% if key information is positioned mid-context rather than at the beginning or end. This decline is more pronounced as the number of retrieved documents increases, highlighting RAG\u2019s limited contextual awareness. In the context of networking, this weakness in missing information located in the middle of the database can raise problems with inaccurate mapping of network information, such as the connection information among devices.\n\n2. **Incomplete Retrievals**: RAG may retrieve irrelevant or partially relevant data due to its lack of structured understanding of relationships between data points. As experiments in [10] demonstrate, irrelevant content within the same topic can significantly impact LLM performance, decreasing generation accuracy by over 10%. This issue underscores RAG\u2019s difficulty in consistently providing comprehensive and accurate outputs. In the context of network optimization, such inaccurate retrieval can provide significantly negative influences on the decision-making process.\n\n3. **Challenges with Complex Queries**: RAG has limitations when handling complex queries that require synthesizing information from multiple sources or summarizing large documents. For instance, multi-document summarization experiments in [11] show that models including T5, BART, and PEGASUS achieve low ROUGE-L scores (below 0.2) on complex summarization tasks, indicating difficulty in generating cohesive summaries across related content. In the context of networking, lacking the capability to handle complex queries and summarize information can result in difficulties in obtaining a comprehensive overview of the network environment.\n\n## GraphRAG: Take One Step Further\nDespite previous enhancements, RAG\u2019s effectiveness in query-focused abstractive summarization over entire corpora remains limited. To address this, GraphRAG combines the strengths of RAG and knowledge graphs, overcoming each framework\u2019s limitations while enhancing its advantages.\n\n1. **Database Structure**: GraphRAG builds upon RAG\u2019s core features, adding a graph-structured database where entities and relationships are extracted by LLMs. Flat text chunks are mapped to entities and relationships within the knowledge graph, with vector embeddings facilitating retrieval. Furthermore, entities are organized into topic-centered communities through clustering algorithms, enabling retrieval from varying levels of abstraction and providing multi-angled insights into the database. In network applications, for example, such database structure can be obtained through the extraction of the interconnections among network devices, with entities representing the devices and relationships (edges) representing the connections.\n\n2. **Enhanced Retrieval Methods**: GraphRAG supports two synergistic retrieval modes: Local Search and Global Search. For Local Search, this method retrieves entity-specific information by traversing the graph\u2019s nodes (entities) and edges (relationships), capturing complex interdependencies to respond effectively to specific queries. For Global Search, Community-based retrieval uses summaries of topic-centered communities to answer broader queries. For example, considering a knowledge graph representing the network environment, the retrieval starts from the queried devices in the knowledge graph, then moves along their connections, and finally incorporates the explored information to identify the internet information (e.g., channel information, interconnections) around the queried devices.\n\nThe key characteristics of GraphRAG can be summarized in Figure 2. As a validation of GraphRAG\u2019s advantages, experiments in [12] comparing GraphRAG and vanilla RAG on various generation tasks demonstrated that GraphRAG improves answer comprehensiveness, diversity, and empowerment by approximately 30%, producing more contextually helpful responses.

By enabling real-time, context-aware decision-making, RAG helps provide reliable information about the network environment. For example, the authors in [8] introduced a 6G AI agent based on the LangChain framework, incorporating RAG and GPT-4 Turbo. Its performance is assessed across three autonomous driving scenarios, demonstrating effectiveness in real-time road updates, network configuration for tailored requests, and D2D vehicle communication.

Experiments in [9] show that when using GPT-3.5-Turbo for multi-document QA tasks, performance drops by over 20% if key information is positioned mid-context rather than at the beginning or end. This decline is more pronounced as the number of retrieved documents increases, highlighting RAG\u2019s limited contextual awareness. In the context of networking, this weakness in missing information located in the middle of the database can raise problems with inaccurate mapping of network information, such as the connection information among devices.\n\n2. **Incomplete Retrievals**: RAG may retrieve irrelevant or partially relevant data due to its lack of structured understanding of relationships between data points. As experiments in [10] demonstrate, irrelevant content within the same topic can significantly impact LLM performance, decreasing generation accuracy by over 10%. This issue underscores RAG\u2019s difficulty in consistently providing comprehensive and accurate outputs. In the context of network optimization, such inaccurate retrieval can provide significantly negative influences on the decision-making process.\n\n3. **Challenges with Complex Queries**: RAG has limitations when handling complex queries that require synthesizing information from multiple sources or summarizing large documents. For instance, multi-document summarization experiments in [11] show that models including T5, BART, and PEGASUS achieve low ROUGE-L scores (below 0.2) on complex summarization tasks, indicating difficulty in generating cohesive summaries across related content. In the context of networking, lacking the capability to handle complex queries and summarize information can result in difficulties in obtaining a comprehensive overview of the network environment.\n\n## GraphRAG: Take One Step Further\nDespite previous enhancements, RAG\u2019s effectiveness in query-focused abstractive summarization over entire corpora remains limited.

Furthermore, entities are organized into topic-centered communities through clustering algorithms, enabling retrieval from varying levels of abstraction and providing multi-angled insights into the database. In network applications, for example, such database structure can be obtained through the extraction of the interconnections among network devices, with entities representing the devices and relationships (edges) representing the connections.\n\n2. **Enhanced Retrieval Methods**: GraphRAG supports two synergistic retrieval modes: Local Search and Global Search. For Local Search, this method retrieves entity-specific information by traversing the graph\u2019s nodes (entities) and edges (relationships), capturing complex interdependencies to respond effectively to specific queries. For Global Search, Community-based retrieval uses summaries of topic-centered communities to answer broader queries.

This approach allows models to pull in relevant information from external databases or documents, improving their output quality and contextual accuracy.\n\nRAG operates by combining the strengths of retrieval systems with generative capabilities. It retrieves pertinent documents or data before generating responses, which can lead to more informed and contextually rich outputs. This method has been particularly effective in applications that require real-time decision-making and context-aware responses, as evidenced by its implementation in a 6G AI agent based on the LangChain framework. This AI agent demonstrated significant improvements in network reliability and performance across various autonomous driving scenarios, showcasing RAG's potential in dynamic environments (Document 1).\n\nHowever, RAG is not without its limitations. One major challenge is its lack of contextual awareness, especially when dealing with complex interrelated information spread across multiple documents. Studies have shown that performance can decline notably if key information is situated in the middle of texts rather than at the beginning or end. This limitation poses risks in accurately mapping network information, particularly in networking applications where precise data connections are crucial (Document 1).\n\nMoreover, RAG can struggle with incomplete retrievals, sometimes pulling irrelevant or partially relevant data due to an inadequate understanding of the relationships between various data points. This issue can adversely affect the accuracy of generative outputs, as experiments have shown significant drops in performance when irrelevant content is present (Document 1). Additionally, handling complex queries remains a challenge for RAG, particularly when synthesizing information from numerous sources or summarizing large amounts of data. This limitation can hinder the model's effectiveness in providing comprehensive insights in intricate scenarios (Document 1).\n\nTo address these challenges, innovations such as GraphRAG have been developed. GraphRAG builds on the RAG framework by incorporating knowledge graphs to enhance the retrieval process. By structuring data into a graph, it facilitates better understanding and retrieval of entities and their relationships. This allows for improved contextual comprehension and retrieval efficiency, especially in complex query scenarios, and leads to more accurate and relevant outputs (Document 1).

By enabling real-time, context-aware decision-making, RAG helps provide reliable information about the network environment. For example, the authors in [8] introduced a 6G AI agent based on the LangChain framework, incorporating RAG and GPT-4 Turbo. Its performance is assessed across three autonomous driving scenarios, demonstrating effectiveness in real-time road updates, network configuration for tailored requests, and D2D vehicle communication. Results confirm its ability to enhance network reliability and performance significantly.\n\n## RAG Limitations\nDespite RAG\u2019s advancements in enhancing generative model performance through retrieval, it has certain limitations:\n\n1. **Lack of Contextual Awareness**: RAG can struggle with capturing full contextual information, especially with interrelated entities across multiple document sections or crucial data embedded in the middle of text. Experiments in [9] show that when using GPT-3.5-Turbo for multi-document QA tasks, performance drops by over 20% if key information is positioned mid-context rather than at the beginning or end. This decline is more pronounced as the number of retrieved documents increases, highlighting RAG\u2019s limited contextual awareness. In the context of networking, this weakness in missing information located in the middle of the database can raise problems with inaccurate mapping of network information, such as the connection information among devices.\n\n2. **Incomplete Retrievals**: RAG may retrieve irrelevant or partially relevant data due to its lack of structured understanding of relationships between data points. As experiments in [10] demonstrate, irrelevant content within the same topic can significantly impact LLM performance, decreasing generation accuracy by over 10%. This issue underscores RAG\u2019s difficulty in consistently providing comprehensive and accurate outputs. In the context of network optimization, such inaccurate retrieval can provide significantly negative influences on the decision-making process.\n\n3. **Challenges with Complex Queries**: RAG has limitations when handling complex queries that require synthesizing information from multiple sources or summarizing large documents. For instance, multi-document summarization experiments in [11] show that models including T5, BART, and PEGASUS achieve low ROUGE-L scores (below 0.2) on complex summarization tasks, indicating difficulty in generating cohesive summaries across related content. In the context of networking, lacking the capability to handle complex queries and summarize information can result in difficulties in obtaining a comprehensive overview of the network environment.\n\n## GraphRAG: Take One Step Further\nDespite previous enhancements, RAG\u2019s effectiveness in query-focused abstractive summarization over entire corpora remains limited. To address this, GraphRAG combines the strengths of RAG and knowledge graphs, overcoming each framework\u2019s limitations while enhancing its advantages.\n\n1. **Database Structure**: GraphRAG builds upon RAG\u2019s core features, adding a graph-structured database where entities and relationships are extracted by LLMs. Flat text chunks are mapped to entities and relationships within the knowledge graph, with vector embeddings facilitating retrieval. Furthermore, entities are organized into topic-centered communities through clustering algorithms, enabling retrieval from varying levels of abstraction and providing multi-angled insights into the database. In network applications, for example, such database structure can be obtained through the extraction of the interconnections among network devices, with entities representing the devices and relationships (edges) representing the connections.\n\n2. **Enhanced Retrieval Methods**: GraphRAG supports two synergistic retrieval modes: Local Search and Global Search. For Local Search, this method retrieves entity-specific information by traversing the graph\u2019s nodes (entities) and edges (relationships), capturing complex interdependencies to respond effectively to specific queries. For Global Search, Community-based retrieval uses summaries of topic-centered communities to answer broader queries. For example, considering a knowledge graph representing the network environment, the retrieval starts from the queried devices in the knowledge graph, then moves along their connections, and finally incorporates the explored information to identify the internet information (e.g., channel information, interconnections) around the queried devices.\n\nThe key characteristics of GraphRAG can be summarized in Figure 2. As a validation of GraphRAG\u2019s advantages, experiments in [12] comparing GraphRAG and vanilla RAG on various generation tasks demonstrated that GraphRAG improves answer comprehensiveness, diversity, and empowerment by approximately 30%, producing more contextually helpful responses.

Feeding the glossary into the graph is crucial because it provides a predefined set of domain-specific terms and definitions that can enhance the semantic richness of the graph. Incorporating the glossary ensures that key terms are properly represented as entities within the graph, improving the traceability and contextual understanding of requirements in relation to higher-level standards and regulations.\n\n**Chunking Documents:** The final step before constructing the graph is to segment cross-referenced documents into manageable text chunks. Chunking is essential to balance the efficiency and accuracy of downstream processes. The size of these chunks significantly impacts the performance of subsequent tasks. Smaller chunks provide better recall of entities and relationships as they fit within the context window of LLMs, minimizing the risk of losing critical information. However, smaller chunks require more processing calls to cover the entire document. Conversely, larger chunks reduce the number of processing calls but may degrade recall due to the limited context-handling capacity of LLMs. Thus, the choice of chunk size represents a trade-off between processing efficiency and the quality of extracted information, making it a crucial consideration in the Graph-RAG pipeline.\n\n----\n\n**Graph-RAG module**\n- **Element Extraction**\n- **Graph Construction**\n- **Community Summarization**\n\n**Cross-reference Documents**\n**Chunked Documents**\n**LLM-based Search and Evaluation**\n**Reference Context**\n**Query LLM**\n**Prompts**\n**Query Graph**\n**Report**\n**Requirement**\n\n*Fig. 2 The automated framework diagram.*"], "title": "", "meta": {"score": 4.87283754, "chunkIndex": 9, "context": "{\"metadata\":{\"filename\":\"2412.08593v1.pdf\",\"lastModified\":\"2024-12-24T20:23:57.624Z\",\"importance\":1,\"contextualRelevance\":1,\"file_path\":\"/tmp/llama_parse_1735071785299_2412.08593v1.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"llama_parse_1735071785299_2412.08593v1.pdf\",\"continuous_mode\":true,\"resultType\":\"markdown\",\"options\":{\"auto_mode\":true,\"auto_mode_trigger_on_table_in_page\":true,\"auto_mode_trigger_on_image_in_page\":true},\"enriched\":true,\"enrichmentTimestamp\":\"2024-12-24T20:23:57.625Z\",\"processingTimestamp\":1735071838836}}", "documentId": "89cb7cbe-9851-415c-9d4d-d127858fa700", "embeddingMetadata": "{\"model\":\"text-embedding-3-large\",\"quality\":{\"l2Norm\":1.0000000104796098,\"meanComponent\":-0.0002400202076193682,\"stdDev\":0.01804059950378397}}", "filename": "2412.08593v1.pdf", "mimeType": "application/pdf", "model": "text-embedding-3-large", "nodeIndex": 9, "originalFormat": "application/pdf", "processingTime": 53538, "processingTimestamp": 1735071838836, "processor": "LlamaParseProcessor", "quality": "{\"l2Norm\":0.9999999932948934,\"meanComponent\":-0.00023703165616503885,\"stdDev\":0.0180406387071524}", "semantic": "{\"type\":\"section\",\"name\":\"section_9\",\"complexity\":{\"cyclomaticComplexity\":1,\"nestingDepth\":0,\"dependencyCount\":0,\"referencedSymbols\":[]}}", "source": "{\"documentId\":\"proj_7a003d9e81dd45dcb08a9de26b3b6ee7_89cb7cbe-9851-415c-9d4d-d127858fa700\",\"mimeType\":\"application/pdf\",\"startLine\":0,\"endLine\":0,\"processingTimestamp\":1735071838836}", "sourceFileBucket": "prod-uploads", "sourceFilePath": "7a003d9e-81dd-45dc-b08a-9de26b3b6ee7/2024-12-24/e3daa621-1297-4207-be2a-266bc2746351_2412.08593v1.pdf", "text": "Document: 2412.08593v1.pdf\nType: application/pdf\nModified: 2024-12-24T20:23:57.624Z\nChunk: 10 of 32\n\n**Extracting the Glossary:** The glossary of terms is extracted as part of pre-processing.

Formal Language RAG\n\nThe FL RAG system incorporates formal mathematical language, specifically Lean code, into the retrieval process. This approach involves an additional step of translating the NL query into a formal representation before performing retrieval. When the user inputs a mathematical question in NL, the system first translates this query into a Lean formal statement. This translation is accomplished using a fine-tuned version of GPT-4o-mini, which was trained on a dataset [Ying et al., 2024] consisting of pairs of NL statements and their corresponding Lean formalizations.\n\nThe Lean-formatted query is then embedded using text-embeddings-ada-002 (we found text-embeddings-ada-002 to be capable of handling FL as well as text). Next, the query embedding is used to search within a vector database constructed from formal mathematical statements in Lean. This database was created by translating the same MATH dataset [Hendrycks et al., 2021], in order to ensure results aren\u2019t impacted by the knowledge corpus used.\n\nThe system retrieves the top k Lean documents that are semantically similar to the query. These retrieved documents are then combined with the original NL query to form the context for the language model. The combined context and query are input into the GPT-4o model, which generates an answer that incorporates formal reasoning. The system prompt for the model was the same as the one used in the NL RAG, which is \"Solve the following math problem. Give the final answer within {}. Like so: the final answer is {answer}\". The GPT-4o model is prompted with FL context. The generated answer is then presented to the user.\n\n```\nInput query\nGPT 4o-mini Query\nTranslation to LEAN\ntranslated query-\nvector              Relevant\nTranslatedQuery Embedding                         database              Documents-    GPT 40 Answer Generation\nsearch\nAnswer\nFormal Language RAG Flowchart\n```\n\n# C. Model Fine-Tuning\n\nThe fine-tuning of GPT-4o-mini was a critical component of the FL RAG system. We trained the model on the dataset of NL and Lean code pairs, optimizing it to accurately translate NL mathematical statements into Lean code.

The training data used to fine-tune the model are over 10 million tokens worth of statement pairs in NL and FL taken from the Lean Workbook dataset [Ying et al., 2024], each statement in natural language was paired by a translated statement in Lean, and signed with \u201cby sorry\u201d indicating the end of the proof.\n\nThe following is an example of a statement that we translated using the fine-tuned model:\n\n**Example Statement:** Let h(b) = 444*b.

LLMs serve as the foundation for query generation and response synthesis, but their token limits and processing capabilities significantly impact the system\u2019s efficiency and scalability. LLMs can be broadly categorized into two types: local models and API-based models. Both categories have unique advantages and challenges, making the decision highly dependent on factors such as data sensitivity, computational resources, and scalability requirements.\n\n### Local LLMs\n\nLocal LLMs, such as Mistral, Zephyr, and Llama, operate within an organization\u2019s infrastructure, providing complete control over sensitive or proprietary data. This makes them particularly suitable for industries like healthcare and finance, where data privacy and regulatory compliance are critical. Local deployment ensures that no sensitive data leaves the premises, mitigating risks associated with data breaches. However, these models require substantial computational resources, including high-performance GPUs, for efficient operation, which can increase the cost and complexity of deployment.\n\n### API-Based LLMs\n\nAPI-based LLMs, such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT models and Google\u2019s Gemini family, are hosted on cloud platforms and eliminate the need for maintaining extensive infrastructure. They are easy to integrate, benefit from continuous updates, and provide high scalability, making them ideal for applications requiring dynamic workloads. Despite these advantages, API-based models introduce concerns regarding data privacy, as sensitive information must be transmitted to external servers for processing. Additionally, their token-based pricing models can lead to unpredictable costs for applications with heavy usage.\n\n### Token Constraints\n\nToken constraints further influence the choice of LLMs in RAG systems. Both local and API-based models impose limits on the amount of data that can be processed in a single query, necessitating the use of efficient data chunking and retrieval techniques.\n\n#### Table 1: Comparison of Local and API-Based LLMs\n\n| Model Type      | LLM Provider | LLM Model          | Context Window                     |\n|------------------|--------------|--------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Local LLMs       | Mistral      | Mistral 7B        | 4096 - 16K (Sliding Windows)      |\n|                  | Huggingface  | Zephyr             | 8192                               |\n|                  | Microsoft    | Phi-2             | 2048                               |\n|                  | Meta         | Llama 3           | 8192                               |\n| API-Based LLMs   | OpenAI       | GPT-4             | 128,000                            |\n|                  | OpenAI       | GPT-4 Turbo       | 128,000                            |\n|                  | OpenAI       | GPT-3.5 Turbo     | 16,385                             |\n|                  | Google       | Gemini 1.5 Flash   | 1,048,576                          |\n|                  | Google       | Gemini 1.5 Pro     | 2,097,152                          |\n\nThe selection of an LLM for RAG systems depends on a balance of priorities. Local models are better suited for scenarios where data privacy and control are paramount, while API-based models excel in environments that demand scalability and ease of integration. Hybrid approaches that combine local processing for sensitive data with cloud-based solutions for less critical tasks represent a promising direction for future advancements.

LLMs serve as the foundation for query generation and response synthesis, but their token limits and processing capabilities significantly impact the system\u2019s efficiency and scalability. LLMs can be broadly categorized into two types: local models and API-based models. Both categories have unique advantages and challenges, making the decision highly dependent on factors such as data sensitivity, computational resources, and scalability requirements.\n\n### Local LLMs\n\nLocal LLMs, such as Mistral, Zephyr, and Llama, operate within an organization\u2019s infrastructure, providing complete control over sensitive or proprietary data. This makes them particularly suitable for industries like healthcare and finance, where data privacy and regulatory compliance are critical. Local deployment ensures that no sensitive data leaves the premises, mitigating risks associated with data breaches. However, these models require substantial computational resources, including high-performance GPUs, for efficient operation, which can increase the cost and complexity of deployment.\n\n### API-Based LLMs\n\nAPI-based LLMs, such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT models and Google\u2019s Gemini family, are hosted on cloud platforms and eliminate the need for maintaining extensive infrastructure. They are easy to integrate, benefit from continuous updates, and provide high scalability, making them ideal for applications requiring dynamic workloads. Despite these advantages, API-based models introduce concerns regarding data privacy, as sensitive information must be transmitted to external servers for processing. Additionally, their token-based pricing models can lead to unpredictable costs for applications with heavy usage.\n\n### Token Constraints\n\nToken constraints further influence the choice of LLMs in RAG systems. Both local and API-based models impose limits on the amount of data that can be processed in a single query, necessitating the use of efficient data chunking and retrieval techniques.\n\n#### Table 1: Comparison of Local and API-Based LLMs\n\n| Model Type      | LLM Provider | LLM Model          | Context Window                     |\n|------------------|--------------|--------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Local LLMs       | Mistral      | Mistral 7B        | 4096 - 16K (Sliding Windows)      |\n|                  | Huggingface  | Zephyr             | 8192                               |\n|                  | Microsoft    | Phi-2             | 2048                               |\n|                  | Meta         | Llama 3           | 8192                               |\n| API-Based LLMs   | OpenAI       | GPT-4             | 128,000                            |\n|                  | OpenAI       | GPT-4 Turbo       | 128,000                            |\n|                  | OpenAI       | GPT-3.5 Turbo     | 16,385                             |\n|                  | Google       | Gemini 1.5 Flash   | 1,048,576                          |\n|                  | Google       | Gemini 1.5 Pro     | 2,097,152                          |\n\nThe selection of an LLM for RAG systems depends on a balance of priorities. Local models are better suited for scenarios where data privacy and control are paramount, while API-based models excel in environments that demand scalability and ease of integration. Hybrid approaches that combine local processing for sensitive data with cloud-based solutions for less critical tasks represent a promising direction for future advancements. Such systems could offer the best of both worlds, enabling organizations to achieve a balance between privacy, performance, and cost-effectiveness in RAG systems.\n\n## 2.4 Prompt Engineering for Multi-Agent RAG Systems\n\nPrompt engineering is a crucial aspect of the Multi-Agent RAG System, as it directly influences the quality and accuracy of the generated queries. Few-shot prompting is particularly effective in this context, as it provides the agent with examples of how to interact with a specific database schema. A well-designed prompt includes the user\u2019s query, the database schema, and a few-shot example illustrating how similar queries have been constructed.", "tokenCount": 1117, "transformConfig": "{\"mode\":\"default\",\"options\":{\"auto_mode\":true,\"continuous_mode\":true}}", "hybridScore": "4.82805681"}, "citation_uuid": -1}, {"url": "bffbfc1d-6186-4e9e-a7b9-da9606227a5a", "description": "", "snippets": ["Document: 2411.13773v1.pdf\nType: application/pdf\nModified: 2024-12-24T20:46:46.094Z\nChunk: 2 of 9\n\n# Configuration Tasks in Network Management\n\nRecent studies have explored LLMs\u2019 potential to generate network configurations [10]\u2013[12], detect anomalies [13], and convert textual descriptions into formal specifications [14], [15]. These contributions represent the most frequent applications of LLMs to network management, aiming to reduce manual labor and risks of errors. The work proposed in this paper is complementary to these approaches as they may rely on RAG systems to retrieve network-specific information.\n\n## Application of RAG in Network Management\n\nThe application of RAG within network management has been less explored. RAGLog [16] introduces a novel method for detecting log anomalies using a combination of vector databases and LLMs. This approach allows for the detection of anomalies based on raw log data, adapting to various log sources without extensive preprocessing. While promising for its adaptability, RAGLog encounters challenges related to resource consumption and latency, which could limit its scalability in larger network data.\n\nTelco-RAG [17] targets the processing of 3GPP documents. A pipeline with query enhancement demonstrates improvements in the accuracy of LLMs when handling complex questions related to the telecommunication domain.\n\n## VectorRAG and GraphRAG Approaches\n\nMore generally, VectorRAG, the predominant approach in RAG systems, computes vector embeddings for fixed-size chunks and uses semantic similarity to retrieve information relevant to the input query. However, this method struggles with the nature of network data where domain-specific keywords have different meanings in their context.\n\nGraphRAG [9] is a more advanced approach that integrates KGs with text chunking and embedding. The LLM is used to extract entities and relationships and summarize communities detected in the KG, providing a more structured retrieval (also uses semantic similarity). Although GraphRAG is efficient in summarizing and reporting tasks (see Figure 1a), it falls short in delivering useful answers, particularly when the query includes specific values, such as names or types, that need to be matched exactly in the retrieval as reported in Figure 1b.\n\nHybridRAG [8] combines GraphRAG and VectorRAG. Although this hybrid approach enhances the accuracy and contextual relevance of responses, it inherits the limitations of its base approaches. Another approach uses entity-relationship extraction to create a KG capturing the important information of the source data. The KG is then searched like a database by translating the textual query into a database query [18]. While this allows for accurate retrieval, it can be impractical given the imperfect parsing obtained with LLMs; as shown in Figure 2 where we tested the accuracy of LLM-based configuration parsing against Batfish [2].\n\n## FastRAG: A New Approach\n\nTo address these limitations, FastRAG extracts entities and their properties from source data while mapping each entity to specific lines of the original text. This method enables accurate retrieval using a KG while allowing for text search to handle vague queries and compensate for imperfect entity extraction. Text search, unlike semantic similarity, matches text based on exact wording or structure [19]. Both KG and text searches are performed using GQL queries on a single KG implemented in a graph database. Unlike other methods, FastRAG avoids costly processing of all source data through LLMs by generating JSON schemas and Python code for data structuring and parsing. While demonstrated on logs and configuration data, this approach can be applied to other semi-structured data, such as playbooks and alarms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first RAG system to rely solely on code generation for data processing.\n\n## Example Queries and Responses\n\n```plaintext\n% python ~m graphrag query ~~root ~~method global \"list the interfaces of boza_rtr\"\n```\nCreating LLM client request...\n\n**SUCCESS: Global Search Response:**\n### Interfaces\nThe Boza_RTR router has several interfaces configured for various roles within the network.

The origins of RAG can be traced to foundational work in AI and natural language processing, but specific development details, including the precise individuals and dates associated with the initial concept, are not detailed in the available information. \n\nRAG operates by integrating retrieval mechanisms that allow LLMs to access and utilize a broader spectrum of information, which addresses the limitations of static, pre-trained datasets that LLMs typically rely upon. This integration enables LLMs to perform better on queries that involve dynamic or private data. Traditional RAG systems employ a single-agent architecture, which can be inefficient when managing diverse data sources like relational databases and document stores. Recent developments, such as those proposed by a group of researchers, suggest a Multi-Agent RAG system designed to optimize query generation and data retrieval from multiple sources, enhancing overall efficiency and accuracy (as discussed in the collaborative work by Aniruddha Salve and colleagues).\n\nDespite its advancements, RAG has several limitations. For instance, it can struggle with contextual awareness and incomplete retrievals, which can lead to inaccuracies in the information generated. These limitations are particularly problematic when processing complex queries or synthesizing information from multiple sources. Experimentation has shown that RAG may fail to capture crucial information positioned in the middle of retrieved documents, which significantly affects performance in real-world applications, such as networking environments.\n\nFurthermore, the evolution of RAG has led to innovative variations, like GraphRAG, which merges the original RAG framework with knowledge graph methodologies. GraphRAG aims to enhance contextual understanding and retrieval methods by mapping data into structured entities and relationships, thereby overcoming some limitations inherent in traditional RAG approaches.\n\nIn summary, while the foundational development of RAG is rooted in a broader context of advancements in AI, specific historical details regarding its initial creation are not present in the gathered information. However, its evolution through mechanisms like the Multi-Agent RAG system and GraphRAG indicates ongoing efforts to refine and improve its functionality in diverse applications.", "user_utterance": "${Can you tell me when and by whom RAG was first developed?}", "search_queries": ["when was RAG first developed", "who developed RAG", "history of RAG development"], "search_results": [{"url": "45fdfb96-6610-4c65-bdea-7c705a8ce97e", "description": "", "snippets": ["Document: 2412.07189v1.pdf\nType: application/pdf\nModified: 2024-12-24T20:46:51.699Z\nChunk: 4 of 9\n\n# DRL-PPO Framework\n\n## Enhanced Reliability\nRAG has also shown its effectiveness in enhancing the reliability of networks. By enabling real-time, context-aware decision-making, RAG helps provide reliable information about the network environment. For example, the authors in [8] introduced a 6G AI agent based on the LangChain framework, incorporating RAG and GPT-4 Turbo. Its performance is assessed across three autonomous driving scenarios, demonstrating effectiveness in real-time road updates, network configuration for tailored requests, and D2D vehicle communication. Results confirm its ability to enhance network reliability and performance significantly.\n\n## RAG Limitations\nDespite RAG\u2019s advancements in enhancing generative model performance through retrieval, it has certain limitations:\n\n1. **Lack of Contextual Awareness**: RAG can struggle with capturing full contextual information, especially with interrelated entities across multiple document sections or crucial data embedded in the middle of text. Experiments in [9] show that when using GPT-3.5-Turbo for multi-document QA tasks, performance drops by over 20% if key information is positioned mid-context rather than at the beginning or end. This decline is more pronounced as the number of retrieved documents increases, highlighting RAG\u2019s limited contextual awareness. In the context of networking, this weakness in missing information located in the middle of the database can raise problems with inaccurate mapping of network information, such as the connection information among devices.\n\n2. **Incomplete Retrievals**: RAG may retrieve irrelevant or partially relevant data due to its lack of structured understanding of relationships between data points. As experiments in [10] demonstrate, irrelevant content within the same topic can significantly impact LLM performance, decreasing generation accuracy by over 10%. This issue underscores RAG\u2019s difficulty in consistently providing comprehensive and accurate outputs. In the context of network optimization, such inaccurate retrieval can provide significantly negative influences on the decision-making process.\n\n3. **Challenges with Complex Queries**: RAG has limitations when handling complex queries that require synthesizing information from multiple sources or summarizing large documents. For instance, multi-document summarization experiments in [11] show that models including T5, BART, and PEGASUS achieve low ROUGE-L scores (below 0.2) on complex summarization tasks, indicating difficulty in generating cohesive summaries across related content. In the context of networking, lacking the capability to handle complex queries and summarize information can result in difficulties in obtaining a comprehensive overview of the network environment.\n\n## GraphRAG: Take One Step Further\nDespite previous enhancements, RAG\u2019s effectiveness in query-focused abstractive summarization over entire corpora remains limited. To address this, GraphRAG combines the strengths of RAG and knowledge graphs, overcoming each framework\u2019s limitations while enhancing its advantages.\n\n1. **Database Structure**: GraphRAG builds upon RAG\u2019s core features, adding a graph-structured database where entities and relationships are extracted by LLMs. Flat text chunks are mapped to entities and relationships within the knowledge graph, with vector embeddings facilitating retrieval. Furthermore, entities are organized into topic-centered communities through clustering algorithms, enabling retrieval from varying levels of abstraction and providing multi-angled insights into the database. In network applications, for example, such database structure can be obtained through the extraction of the interconnections among network devices, with entities representing the devices and relationships (edges) representing the connections.\n\n2. **Enhanced Retrieval Methods**: GraphRAG supports two synergistic retrieval modes: Local Search and Global Search. For Local Search, this method retrieves entity-specific information by traversing the graph\u2019s nodes (entities) and edges (relationships), capturing complex interdependencies to respond effectively to specific queries. For Global Search, Community-based retrieval uses summaries of topic-centered communities to answer broader queries. For example, considering a knowledge graph representing the network environment, the retrieval starts from the queried devices in the knowledge graph, then moves along their connections, and finally incorporates the explored information to identify the internet information (e.g., channel information, interconnections) around the queried devices.\n\nThe key characteristics of GraphRAG can be summarized in Figure 2. As a validation of GraphRAG\u2019s advantages, experiments in [12] comparing GraphRAG and vanilla RAG on various generation tasks demonstrated that GraphRAG improves answer comprehensiveness, diversity, and empowerment by approximately 30%, producing more contextually helpful responses. In networking optimization, GraphRAG offers distinct advantages, including:\n\n- **Enhanced Contextual Understanding**: GraphRAG leverages the inherent relationships between entities in a knowledge graph, enabling a deeper and more accurate understanding of context.

Specialized agents, each optimized for a specific data source, handle query generation for relational, NoSQL, and document-based systems. These agents collaborate within a modular framework, with query execution delegated to an environment designed for compatibility across various database types. This distributed approach enhances query efficiency, reduces token overhead, and improves response accuracy by ensuring that each agent focuses on its specialized task.\n\nThe proposed system is scalable and adaptable, making it ideal for generative AI workflows that require integration with diverse, dynamic, or private data sources. By leveraging specialized agents and a modular execution environment, the system provides an efficient and robust solution for handling complex, heterogeneous data environments in generative AI applications.\n\n----\n\n**Keywords:** Multi-Agent RAG Systems \u00b7 Retrieval-Augmented Generation \u00b7 Large Language Models \u00b7 Database Integration \u00b7 Generative AI", "tokenCount": 620, "transformConfig": "{\"mode\":\"default\",\"options\":{\"auto_mode\":true,\"continuous_mode\":true}}", "hybridScore": "2.86279082"}, "citation_uuid": -1}, {"url": "d938d2d1-88ba-4185-a829-418f6056d8c8", "description": "", "snippets": ["Document: 2412.05223v1.pdf\nType: application/pdf\nModified: 2024-12-24T20:22:58.769Z\nChunk: 10 of 12\n\n**References:**\n\n[18] Mehul et al.

These contributions represent the most frequent applications of LLMs to network management, aiming to reduce manual labor and risks of errors. The work proposed in this paper is complementary to these approaches as they may rely on RAG systems to retrieve network-specific information.\n\n## Application of RAG in Network Management\n\nThe application of RAG within network management has been less explored. RAGLog [16] introduces a novel method for detecting log anomalies using a combination of vector databases and LLMs. This approach allows for the detection of anomalies based on raw log data, adapting to various log sources without extensive preprocessing. While promising for its adaptability, RAGLog encounters challenges related to resource consumption and latency, which could limit its scalability in larger network data.\n\nTelco-RAG [17] targets the processing of 3GPP documents. A pipeline with query enhancement demonstrates improvements in the accuracy of LLMs when handling complex questions related to the telecommunication domain.\n\n## VectorRAG and GraphRAG Approaches\n\nMore generally, VectorRAG, the predominant approach in RAG systems, computes vector embeddings for fixed-size chunks and uses semantic similarity to retrieve information relevant to the input query. However, this method struggles with the nature of network data where domain-specific keywords have different meanings in their context.\n\nGraphRAG [9] is a more advanced approach that integrates KGs with text chunking and embedding. The LLM is used to extract entities and relationships and summarize communities detected in the KG, providing a more structured retrieval (also uses semantic similarity). Although GraphRAG is efficient in summarizing and reporting tasks (see Figure 1a), it falls short in delivering useful answers, particularly when the query includes specific values, such as names or types, that need to be matched exactly in the retrieval as reported in Figure 1b.\n\nHybridRAG [8] combines GraphRAG and VectorRAG. Although this hybrid approach enhances the accuracy and contextual relevance of responses, it inherits the limitations of its base approaches. Another approach uses entity-relationship extraction to create a KG capturing the important information of the source data. The KG is then searched like a database by translating the textual query into a database query [18]. While this allows for accurate retrieval, it can be impractical given the imperfect parsing obtained with LLMs; as shown in Figure 2 where we tested the accuracy of LLM-based configuration parsing against Batfish [2].\n\n## FastRAG: A New Approach\n\nTo address these limitations, FastRAG extracts entities and their properties from source data while mapping each entity to specific lines of the original text. This method enables accurate retrieval using a KG while allowing for text search to handle vague queries and compensate for imperfect entity extraction. Text search, unlike semantic similarity, matches text based on exact wording or structure [19]. Both KG and text searches are performed using GQL queries on a single KG implemented in a graph database. Unlike other methods, FastRAG avoids costly processing of all source data through LLMs by generating JSON schemas and Python code for data structuring and parsing. While demonstrated on logs and configuration data, this approach can be applied to other semi-structured data, such as playbooks and alarms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first RAG system to rely solely on code generation for data processing.\n\n## Example Queries and Responses\n\n```plaintext\n% python ~m graphrag query ~~root ~~method global \"list the interfaces of boza_rtr\"\n```\nCreating LLM client request...\n\n**SUCCESS: Global Search Response:**\n### Interfaces\nThe Boza_RTR router has several interfaces configured for various roles within the network.

Enhancing inter-agent communication and collaboration is a key area of focus. By enabling agents to share intermediate insights or partial results, the system could better handle multi-faceted and complex queries, ensuring a seamless flow of information across agents. This improvement would enable the system to address cross-domain challenges more effectively and boost its overall performance in handling intricate workflows.\n\nAnother promising avenue lies in incorporating adaptive learning mechanisms. By embedding feedback loops into the system, the generative agent and query generation agents could evolve to refine their outputs dynamically. This approach would allow the system to learn from user interactions, improving its ability to produce accurate and contextually relevant responses over time, even as the data landscape changes. Adaptive learning ensures the system remains robust and responsive to new and complex challenges.\n\nOptimizing prompt engineering strategies is also an essential area for improvement. Fine-tuning prompts to maximize agent efficiency could lead to better query generation and response synthesis. By leveraging advanced methods for prompt design, the system could minimize token overhead, reduce latency, and ensure responses are both precise and coherent.\n\n----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe proposed Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system represents a significant advancement in leveraging generative AI for diverse and complex data environments. By introducing specialized agents tailored for different database types, a centralized query execution environment, and a generative agent for synthesizing responses, this framework addresses critical limitations of traditional single-agent RAG systems. It enhances query precision, optimizes token usage, and ensures scalability across heterogeneous data sources.\n\nThe system\u2019s modular architecture demonstrates adaptability across various industries, from healthcare to logistics, where seamless integration with relational, document-based, and graph databases is vital. Furthermore, the focus on error handling, efficient resource utilization, and reducing computational overhead establishes the proposed solution as robust and reliable for real-world applications.\n\nLooking ahead, this research lays the foundation for future advancements in multi-agent systems, including improved inter-agent collaboration, adaptive learning capabilities, and refined prompt engineering strategies.

Enhancing inter-agent communication and collaboration is a key area of focus. By enabling agents to share intermediate insights or partial results, the system could better handle multi-faceted and complex queries, ensuring a seamless flow of information across agents. This improvement would enable the system to address cross-domain challenges more effectively and boost its overall performance in handling intricate workflows.\n\nAnother promising avenue lies in incorporating adaptive learning mechanisms. By embedding feedback loops into the system, the generative agent and query generation agents could evolve to refine their outputs dynamically. This approach would allow the system to learn from user interactions, improving its ability to produce accurate and contextually relevant responses over time, even as the data landscape changes. Adaptive learning ensures the system remains robust and responsive to new and complex challenges.\n\nOptimizing prompt engineering strategies is also an essential area for improvement. Fine-tuning prompts to maximize agent efficiency could lead to better query generation and response synthesis. By leveraging advanced methods for prompt design, the system could minimize token overhead, reduce latency, and ensure responses are both precise and coherent.\n\n----\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe proposed Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system represents a significant advancement in leveraging generative AI for diverse and complex data environments. By introducing specialized agents tailored for different database types, a centralized query execution environment, and a generative agent for synthesizing responses, this framework addresses critical limitations of traditional single-agent RAG systems. It enhances query precision, optimizes token usage, and ensures scalability across heterogeneous data sources.\n\nThe system\u2019s modular architecture demonstrates adaptability across various industries, from healthcare to logistics, where seamless integration with relational, document-based, and graph databases is vital. Furthermore, the focus on error handling, efficient resource utilization, and reducing computational overhead establishes the proposed solution as robust and reliable for real-world applications.\n\nLooking ahead, this research lays the foundation for future advancements in multi-agent systems, including improved inter-agent collaboration, adaptive learning capabilities, and refined prompt engineering strategies. These innovations have the potential to further enhance the system\u2019s efficiency and versatility, making it an indispensable tool for solving increasingly complex and data-intensive problems. This work not only bridges existing gaps in RAG methodologies but also opens new avenues for the thoughtful integration of AI into dynamic and diverse data ecosystems.\n\n----\n\n## References\n\n[1] Humza Naveed, Asad Ullah Khan, Shi Qiu, Muhammad Saqib, Saeed Anwar, Muhammad Usman, Naveed Akhtar, Nick Barnes, and Ajmal Mian.

This issue arises because these models often rely solely on their pre-trained knowledge without access to external, real-time information. RAG addresses this problem by integrating a retrieval system that allows the model to dynamically search a structured external corpus for relevant information in response to specific queries. By grounding generated text in verified information, RAG significantly reduces the occurrence of hallucinations and enhances the factual accuracy of the responses generated (Document [2]).\n\nAdditionally, static language models face challenges with context and coherence, particularly when handling complex queries that require detailed and nuanced information. RAG employs a dual-component architecture that includes a retriever and a generator. The retriever extracts relevant documents based on the input query, which are then provided to the generator as context. This approach ensures that the generated content is enriched with real-world information, enabling the model to synthesize responses that are both coherent and contextually accurate (Document [2]).\n\nToken constraints also represent a limitation in traditional language models, which can only process a limited amount of data in a single query. RAG systems utilize dense vector embeddings to enhance the retrieval process and manage these constraints effectively, allowing for more efficient data chunking and retrieval techniques (Document [1]). By appending the retrieved documents to the model's context, RAG can handle more extensive and complex data inputs, improving the model's ability to generate responses that are contextually relevant and factually consistent (Document [2]).\n\nFinally, the integration of RAG systems can lead to improved performance in complex reasoning tasks, such as multi-step question answering and mathematical proof verification. By combining retrieval mechanisms with language generation, RAG facilitates sequential reasoning support, enabling models to leverage external information at each step of the reasoning process (Document [2]). This dynamic interaction not only enhances the accuracy of outputs but also broadens the applicability of language models across various domains.\n\nIn summary, RAG was designed to overcome limitations related to hallucinations, contextual coherence, token constraints, and complex reasoning in traditional language models, making it a more robust framework for generating accurate and contextually relevant responses.", "user_utterance": "${What were the initial problems or limitations in language models that RAG was designed to address?}", "search_queries": ["What are the limitations of traditional language models?", "What problems did RAG (RetrievalAugmented Generation) aim to solve?", "RAG language model initial challenges"], "search_results": [{"url": "38c90c4b-bb06-4dc8-a3c8-3e998087cc44", "description": "", "snippets": ["Document: 2412.05838v1.pdf\nType: application/pdf\nModified: 2024-12-24T20:28:56.762Z\nChunk: 3 of 16\n\n# Multi-Agent RAG System\n\n## 2.3 Choice of LLM in RAG\n\nThe choice of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a crucial consideration in the design and implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. LLMs serve as the foundation for query generation and response synthesis, but their token limits and processing capabilities significantly impact the system\u2019s efficiency and scalability. LLMs can be broadly categorized into two types: local models and API-based models. Both categories have unique advantages and challenges, making the decision highly dependent on factors such as data sensitivity, computational resources, and scalability requirements.\n\n### Local LLMs\n\nLocal LLMs, such as Mistral, Zephyr, and Llama, operate within an organization\u2019s infrastructure, providing complete control over sensitive or proprietary data. This makes them particularly suitable for industries like healthcare and finance, where data privacy and regulatory compliance are critical. Local deployment ensures that no sensitive data leaves the premises, mitigating risks associated with data breaches. However, these models require substantial computational resources, including high-performance GPUs, for efficient operation, which can increase the cost and complexity of deployment.\n\n### API-Based LLMs\n\nAPI-based LLMs, such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT models and Google\u2019s Gemini family, are hosted on cloud platforms and eliminate the need for maintaining extensive infrastructure. They are easy to integrate, benefit from continuous updates, and provide high scalability, making them ideal for applications requiring dynamic workloads. Despite these advantages, API-based models introduce concerns regarding data privacy, as sensitive information must be transmitted to external servers for processing. Additionally, their token-based pricing models can lead to unpredictable costs for applications with heavy usage.\n\n### Token Constraints\n\nToken constraints further influence the choice of LLMs in RAG systems. Both local and API-based models impose limits on the amount of data that can be processed in a single query, necessitating the use of efficient data chunking and retrieval techniques.\n\n#### Table 1: Comparison of Local and API-Based LLMs\n\n| Model Type      | LLM Provider | LLM Model          | Context Window                     |\n|------------------|--------------|--------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Local LLMs       | Mistral      | Mistral 7B        | 4096 - 16K (Sliding Windows)      |\n|                  | Huggingface  | Zephyr             | 8192                               |\n|                  | Microsoft    | Phi-2             | 2048                               |\n|                  | Meta         | Llama 3           | 8192                               |\n| API-Based LLMs   | OpenAI       | GPT-4             | 128,000                            |\n|                  | OpenAI       | GPT-4 Turbo       | 128,000                            |\n|                  | OpenAI       | GPT-3.5 Turbo     | 16,385                             |\n|                  | Google       | Gemini 1.5 Flash   | 1,048,576                          |\n|                  | Google       | Gemini 1.5 Pro     | 2,097,152                          |\n\nThe selection of an LLM for RAG systems depends on a balance of priorities. Local models are better suited for scenarios where data privacy and control are paramount, while API-based models excel in environments that demand scalability and ease of integration. Hybrid approaches that combine local processing for sensitive data with cloud-based solutions for less critical tasks represent a promising direction for future advancements. Such systems could offer the best of both worlds, enabling organizations to achieve a balance between privacy, performance, and cost-effectiveness in RAG systems.\n\n## 2.4 Prompt Engineering for Multi-Agent RAG Systems\n\nPrompt engineering is a crucial aspect of the Multi-Agent RAG System, as it directly influences the quality and accuracy of the generated queries.

Retrieval-Augmented Language Models\n\nRAG is a sophisticated framework designed to enhance language models by coupling them with external retrieval systems, addressing limitations inherent in static, solely parameter-based language models. RAG integrates a dual-component architecture where a retriever dynamically searches a structured external corpus for relevant information based on the input query, and a generator LLM uses the retrieved content as context to generate accurate and contextually enriched responses [Gao et al., 2023, Mialon et al., 2023].

BACKGROUND\n\n### A. Retrieval-Augmented Language Models\n\nRAG is a sophisticated framework designed to enhance language models by coupling them with external retrieval systems, addressing limitations inherent in static, solely parameter-based language models. RAG integrates a dual-component architecture where a retriever dynamically searches a structured external corpus for relevant information based on the input query, and a generator LLM uses the retrieved content as context to generate accurate and contextually enriched responses [Gao et al., 2023, Mialon et al., 2023]. This setup mitigates common issues such as hallucinations and factual inaccuracies in language models by grounding generated text in real-world, verified information. In practice, RAG systems employ dense vector embeddings to ensure retrieval relevance, capturing semantic relationships within documents beyond mere keyword matching. The retrieved information is subsequently fed into the generator, allowing it to synthesize data with pre-existing knowledge for enhanced coherence and contextual accuracy.\n\nRAGs can employ two main types of retrieval mechanisms: dense and sparse [Mialon et al., 2023]. Sparse retrievers rely on bag-of-words representations, excelling at finding documents with high term overlap to the query, while dense retrievers utilize neural network embeddings to capture semantic similarities, enhancing the model's comprehension of related concepts. By appending retrieved documents directly to the model\u2019s context, these retrievers allow the language model to ground its responses in a broader context, thereby increasing accuracy and factual consistency across complex tasks.\n\nThe success of retrieval-augmented models in various domains has catalyzed interest in their application to more demanding reasoning tasks. A great representative of such tasks is the construction and verification of mathematical proofs, which requires solving problems step-by-step, and generating precise mathematical statements. Recent approaches, such as chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting [Lewkowycz et al., 2022] combined with retrieval, highlight the potential for retrieval-augmented models to provide sequential reasoning support. These models can generate reasoning paths interspersed with retrieval steps to guide complex problem-solving processes, such as multi-step question answering, enabling models to leverage external information dynamically at each reasoning stage.\n\n### B. Autoformalization\n\nAutoformalization is the process of translating informal mathematical expressions, typically written in natural language (NL) or standard mathematical notation, into formalized, machine-readable language that theorem provers and proof assistants (such as Lean) can interpret and verify [Wu et al. (2022)]. This transformation process is complex, requiring the formal system to not only translate symbols accurately but also to grasp the semantic and logical nuances of mathematical language. The goal of autoformalization is to enable computers to autonomously produce valid formal statements from human-readable text, thereby reducing the time and expertise needed to encode informal statements manually into formal systems like Lean.\n\nLLMs can perform autoformalization by using Few-shot prompting. Few-shot prompting is a strategy that provides LLMs with small sets of example pairs, illustrating how informal language maps to formalized statements. These examples help guide the model in recognizing the patterns and syntactic structures unique to formal mathematical language. The LLM can then apply this learned structure to new informal inputs, generating outputs that are syntactically and semantically aligned with formal systems\u2019 requirements. This approach leverages the model's capacity to generalize from limited examples, enabling it to interpret complex mathematical statements and produce formal representations accurately.\n\nThe formalization process requires the LLM to maintain logical coherence across multi-step arguments and correctly interpret mathematical abstractions\u2014tasks that are beyond the capabilities of many general-purpose language models. However, LLMs that are fine-tuned with carefully curated formalization examples show promising results, achieving increasingly accurate interpretations of informal mathematical language. This advancement has significant implications for fields such as formal verification and automated reasoning [Wu et al., 2022].\n\nThe recent advancements in autoformalization and automated theorem proving build upon foundational datasets and innovative training techniques to bridge the gap between NL and formal mathematical systems.

Unlike traditional LLMs, which rely solely on parametric memory, RAG introduces a non-parametric memory in the form of an external database or document index. By retrieving relevant information during the generation process, RAG ensures that outputs are more accurate, contextually grounded, and up-to-date (Lewis et al., 2020).\n\nBuilding upon the RAG framework, Graph-RAG enhances retrieval capabilities by constructing a graph-based text index from external knowledge sources. This method leverages the interconnected nature of data, representing entities and their relationships as a graph structure. By doing so, Graph-RAG improves the precision of retrieval by enabling contextualized exploration of related entities and concepts. This graph-based representation is particularly effective for tasks requiring fine-grained reasoning, such as cross-referencing, where requirements often reference interconnected standards, regulations, and supporting documentation. Graph-RAG not only retrieves relevant content but also provides structured clusters of related entities, facilitating comprehensive cross-referencing and traceability analysis (Gao et al., 2023).\n\n**2.4 Prompt Engineering**\n\nPrompt engineering is the process of designing and refining input instructions, or \"prompts,\" to guide LLMs toward generating desired outputs. A well-crafted prompt provides context, instructions, and sometimes examples to elicit specific responses, improving the quality, relevance, and accuracy of the generated results (Marvin et al., 2024).\n\nChain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thought (ToT) are advanced prompting methods designed to enhance reasoning capabilities in LLMs. CoT prompting involves breaking down a problem into a sequence of intermediate reasoning steps, enabling the model to handle complex tasks like arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning. This step-by-step decomposition not only allows for better allocation of computation resources but also offers interpretability, as the reasoning process becomes transparent and debuggable (Wei et al., 2022).\n\nToT expands on CoT by framing problem-solving as a search process through a tree structure, where each node represents a partial solution and branches signify different reasoning paths. Unlike CoT, which sequentially generates reasoning steps, ToT allows LLMs to explore multiple reasoning paths simultaneously, evaluate their progress, and backtrack when necessary. This deliberate search mechanism significantly improves performance on tasks requiring exploration and strategic planning, such as mathematical puzzles and creative writing (Yao et al., 2024)."], "title": "", "meta": {"score": 3.67456555, "chunkIndex": 4, "context": "{\"metadata\":{\"filename\":\"2412.08593v1.pdf\",\"lastModified\":\"2024-12-24T20:29:07.681Z\",\"importance\":1,\"contextualRelevance\":1,\"file_path\":\"/tmp/llama_parse_1735072141887_2412.08593v1.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"llama_parse_1735072141887_2412.08593v1.pdf\",\"continuous_mode\":true,\"resultType\":\"markdown\",\"options\":{\"auto_mode\":true,\"auto_mode_trigger_on_table_in_page\":true,\"auto_mode_trigger_on_image_in_page\":true},\"enriched\":true,\"enrichmentTimestamp\":\"2024-12-24T20:29:07.681Z\",\"processingTimestamp\":1735072149184}}", "documentId": "89cb7cbe-9851-415c-9d4d-d127858fa700", "embeddingMetadata": "{\"model\":\"text-embedding-3-large\",\"quality\":{\"l2Norm\":1.0000000109572478,\"meanComponent\":0.0002272788198756185,\"stdDev\":0.018040764529392704}}", "filename": "2412.08593v1.pdf", "mimeType": "application/pdf", "model": "text-embedding-3-large", "nodeIndex": 4, "originalFormat": "application/pdf", "processingTime": 7298, "processingTimestamp": 1735072149184, "processor": "LlamaParseProcessor", "quality": "{\"l2Norm\":0.9999999643349334,\"meanComponent\":0.0002249982337664066,\"stdDev\":0.01804079227497207}", "semantic": "{\"type\":\"section\",\"name\":\"section_4\",\"complexity\":{\"cyclomaticComplexity\":1,\"nestingDepth\":0,\"dependencyCount\":0,\"referencedSymbols\":[]}}", "source": "{\"documentId\":\"proj_7a003d9e81dd45dcb08a9de26b3b6ee7_89cb7cbe-9851-415c-9d4d-d127858fa700\",\"mimeType\":\"application/pdf\",\"startLine\":0,\"endLine\":0,\"processingTimestamp\":1735072149184}", "sourceFileBucket": "prod-uploads", "sourceFilePath": "7a003d9e-81dd-45dc-b08a-9de26b3b6ee7/2024-12-24/e3daa621-1297-4207-be2a-266bc2746351_2412.08593v1.pdf", "text": "Document: 2412.08593v1.pdf\nType: application/pdf\nModified: 2024-12-24T20:29:07.681Z\nChunk: 5 of 32\n\n**2.3 Retrieval Augmented Generation**\n\nRAG is a hybrid framework that combines the generative capabilities of LLMs with retrieval mechanisms to enhance performance on knowledge-intensive tasks.

By retrieving relevant information during the generation process, RAG ensures that outputs are more accurate, contextually grounded, and up-to-date (Lewis et al., 2020).\n\nBuilding upon the RAG framework, Graph-RAG enhances retrieval capabilities by constructing a graph-based text index from external knowledge sources. This method leverages the interconnected nature of data, representing entities and their relationships as a graph structure. By doing so, Graph-RAG improves the precision of retrieval by enabling contextualized exploration of related entities and concepts. This graph-based representation is particularly effective for tasks requiring fine-grained reasoning, such as cross-referencing, where requirements often reference interconnected standards, regulations, and supporting documentation. Graph-RAG not only retrieves relevant content but also provides structured clusters of related entities, facilitating comprehensive cross-referencing and traceability analysis (Gao et al., 2023).\n\n**2.4 Prompt Engineering**\n\nPrompt engineering is the process of designing and refining input instructions, or \"prompts,\" to guide LLMs toward generating desired outputs. A well-crafted prompt provides context, instructions, and sometimes examples to elicit specific responses, improving the quality, relevance, and accuracy of the generated results (Marvin et al., 2024).\n\nChain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thought (ToT) are advanced prompting methods designed to enhance reasoning capabilities in LLMs. CoT prompting involves breaking down a problem into a sequence of intermediate reasoning steps, enabling the model to handle complex tasks like arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning. This step-by-step decomposition not only allows for better allocation of computation resources but also offers interpretability, as the reasoning process becomes transparent and debuggable (Wei et al., 2022).\n\nToT expands on CoT by framing problem-solving as a search process through a tree structure, where each node represents a partial solution and branches signify different reasoning paths. Unlike CoT, which sequentially generates reasoning steps, ToT allows LLMs to explore multiple reasoning paths simultaneously, evaluate their progress, and backtrack when necessary.

Addressing issues such as requirement changes and compliance issues at this stage is essential to prevent their propagation and mitigate costly challenges later in the project (Verner et al., 2014; Pacheco et al., 2018; Roy et al., 2016). Specifically, software in regulated environments demands meticulous attention during the requirements specification phase to ensure adherence to stringent standards and regulatory frameworks, which, if overlooked, can lead to significant failures and project setbacks (Marques and Yelisetty, 2019).\n\nRecent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), have motivated researchers in requirements engineering to explore the potential of these tools in enhancing Software Requirement Specification (SRS) documents. Effective compliance checking in SRS documents plays a crucial role in mitigating many associated risks. Luitel et al. (2024) demonstrate how BERT, a Large Language Model, is employed to detect and address incomplete requirements by predicting missing terminology, thereby improving the overall completeness of SRS. In addition to enhancing completeness, LLMs have also shown promise in ensuring regulatory compliance. For instance, the study by Hassani et al. (2024) illustrates how Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) can be evaluated for compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a legal framework aimed at ensuring data privacy in the European Union, using advanced techniques powered by Large Language Models. Their work highlights how automating compliance checks can streamline the validation process, reducing manual efforts and improving accuracy in legal and regulatory adherence.\n\nHowever, LLMs face significant challenges when validating SRS, particularly in regulated environments such as finance and aerospace, where adherence to strict regulations is critical. These challenges include difficulties in maintaining context across extensive documents, which can result in incomplete or inaccurate analysis during requirement compliance checks. A potential solution is to provide the most relevant reference text, allowing for more precise validation of whether a requirement is being violated (Spoletini and Ferrari, 2024). Moreover, hallucination, where models generate factually incorrect yet plausible content, remains a critical issue, particularly when retrieval mechanisms are insufficient and reasoning capabilities fail.

Addressing issues such as requirement changes and compliance issues at this stage is essential to prevent their propagation and mitigate costly challenges later in the project (Verner et al., 2014; Pacheco et al., 2018; Roy et al., 2016). Specifically, software in regulated environments demands meticulous attention during the requirements specification phase to ensure adherence to stringent standards and regulatory frameworks, which, if overlooked, can lead to significant failures and project setbacks (Marques and Yelisetty, 2019).\n\nRecent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), have motivated researchers in requirements engineering to explore the potential of these tools in enhancing Software Requirement Specification (SRS) documents. Effective compliance checking in SRS documents plays a crucial role in mitigating many associated risks. Luitel et al. (2024) demonstrate how BERT, a Large Language Model, is employed to detect and address incomplete requirements by predicting missing terminology, thereby improving the overall completeness of SRS. In addition to enhancing completeness, LLMs have also shown promise in ensuring regulatory compliance. For instance, the study by Hassani et al. (2024) illustrates how Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) can be evaluated for compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), a legal framework aimed at ensuring data privacy in the European Union, using advanced techniques powered by Large Language Models. Their work highlights how automating compliance checks can streamline the validation process, reducing manual efforts and improving accuracy in legal and regulatory adherence.\n\nHowever, LLMs face significant challenges when validating SRS, particularly in regulated environments such as finance and aerospace, where adherence to strict regulations is critical. These challenges include difficulties in maintaining context across extensive documents, which can result in incomplete or inaccurate analysis during requirement compliance checks. A potential solution is to provide the most relevant reference text, allowing for more precise validation of whether a requirement is being violated (Spoletini and Ferrari, 2024). Moreover, hallucination, where models generate factually incorrect yet plausible content, remains a critical issue, particularly when retrieval mechanisms are insufficient and reasoning capabilities fail. Additionally, scalability and performance constraints limit their effectiveness in large, complex projects, and inherent biases in LLMs can result in prioritizing common problems over more nuanced, domain-specific issues (Huang et al., 2023).\n\nIn this work, we propose an automated framework to address the challenges of validating SRS in regulated environments. The framework leverages Graph-RAG to retrieve the most relevant content from reference texts.

These features are akin to the small set of concepts a person might have in mind when reasoning about a situation. We refer to such features as Noun-Phrases, and our Noun-Phrase Dominance Model that predates the OpenAI and Anthropic studies posited that LLMs self-organize around such noun phrases during training [13].\n\n**Long Context RAG**\nRecently, LLMs have greatly increased their context window, allowing a very large amount of text to be sent along with the prompt. Before the advent of long-context language models, RAG was a key solution for overcoming the limitations of small context window sizes. Some researchers have examined if a sufficiently large context window could effectively replace RAG altogether. Databricks examined the effects of increased context size on various modern LLMs. The net result was that no LLM, regardless of the amount of data sent to it, was able to exceed greater than 80% accuracy on various QA benchmarks [6].\n\n**Faithfulness and Correctness**\nTwo terms that are important to understand as it relates to evaluating RAG and LLMs are Faithfulness and Correctness. Faithfulness evaluates whether the generated output accurately reflects the information contained in the retrieved documents [14]. A response is considered faithful if it does not introduce information that is absent from the retrieved sources, and adheres closely to the input data. This criterion measures how consistently the LLM response aligns with the retrieved content. A perfect faithfulness score means there is no \"hallucination\" caused by deviation from the content (such as by introducing new facts or interpretations). In other words, a faithful response directly reflects the content of the retrieved documents, with all statements fully supported by the retrieved data.\n\nCorrectness, on the other hand, assesses the factual accuracy of the output within a broader context [14]. A response is deemed correct if it aligns with established facts, even when those facts are not explicitly present in the retrieved documents. Correctness measures how well the generated answer matches verified external knowledge. For instance, a correct response is factually accurate based on real-world information, even if some of that information originates from the model\u2019s parametric knowledge rather than the retrieved (non-parametric) sources. Faithfulness ensures that the response stays true to the retrieved information, while correctness ensures that the response is factually accurate, regardless of its source.\n\n**Explanation of Acurai Terms**\nWe use the terms \"accurate\" and \"faithful\" herein interchangeably. For our primary use case (enterprise chatbots), the goal is to provide answers that are faithful to the information provided. For example, if an enterprise customer is a car company, they want their chatbot to be faithful to the documents provided to the chatbot, which may say their cars are \"the best\". This faithful answer may not be an objectively quantifiable answer; and perhaps even according to a third party, this company\u2019s cars are not, in fact, \"the best\". In many chatbots, correctness can be ambiguous or debatable, depending on the topic and question asked (\"Who is the greatest opera singer of all time?\"), whereas faithfulness can always be measured in concrete terms.\n\nIn a RAG-based chatbot, we refer to hallucinations as referring to any deviation from the provided context. Importantly, LLMs can still hallucinate even when clearly written facts are sent along with the query. For example, ChatGPT-3.5 Turbo was provided the following clearly written statements about calcium: \"Calcium is a sliver-grey metal. Calcium melts at 840\u00b0C. Calcium boils at 1484\u00b0C to produce monatomic gas. ...\" Remarkably, the LLM stated that all these properties belonged to magnesium when given the following instruction: \"Extract all facts about magnesium from the following passages.\" [15] The calcium statements could not be more clearly written. The prompt also clearly asks about magnesium. Nevertheless, the LLM treated magnesium as if it is the same thing as calcium. Acurai\u2019s Noun-Phrase Dominance Model says that all hallucinations occur when the LLM mistakes two distinct Noun-Phrases as being the same thing. More specifically, the LLM does so when the distinct noun phrases are semantically similar, such as is the case with calcium and magnesium [16]."], "title": "", "meta": {"score": 3.65222406, "chunkIndex": 2, "context": "{\"metadata\":{\"filename\":\"2412.05223v1.pdf\",\"lastModified\":\"2024-12-24T20:29:08.349Z\",\"importance\":1,\"contextualRelevance\":1,\"file_path\":\"/tmp/llama_parse_1735072142721_2412.05223v1.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"llama_parse_1735072142721_2412.05223v1.pdf\",\"continuous_mode\":true,\"resultType\":\"markdown\",\"options\":{\"auto_mode\":true,\"auto_mode_trigger_on_table_in_page\":true,\"auto_mode_trigger_on_image_in_page\":true},\"enriched\":true,\"enrichmentTimestamp\":\"2024-12-24T20:29:08.349Z\",\"processingTimestamp\":1735072149236}}", "documentId": "b26a8577-1b29-4b7e-bc66-8356fd2e4df7", "embeddingMetadata": "{\"model\":\"text-embedding-3-large\",\"quality\":{\"l2Norm\":1.0000000595116685,\"meanComponent\":-0.00040061394320540394,\"stdDev\":0.01803774876603008}}", "filename": "2412.05223v1.pdf", "mimeType": "application/pdf", "model": "text-embedding-3-large", "nodeIndex": 2, "originalFormat": "application/pdf", "processingTime": 6515, "processingTimestamp": 1735072149236, "processor": "LlamaParseProcessor", "quality": "{\"l2Norm\":1.0000000196273633,\"meanComponent\":-0.0003968449089041993,\"stdDev\":0.018037831361608882}", "semantic": "{\"type\":\"section\",\"name\":\"section_2\",\"complexity\":{\"cyclomaticComplexity\":1,\"nestingDepth\":0,\"dependencyCount\":0,\"referencedSymbols\":[]}}", "source": "{\"documentId\":\"proj_7a003d9e81dd45dcb08a9de26b3b6ee7_b26a8577-1b29-4b7e-bc66-8356fd2e4df7\",\"mimeType\":\"application/pdf\",\"startLine\":0,\"endLine\":0,\"processingTimestamp\":1735072149236}", "sourceFileBucket": "prod-uploads", "sourceFilePath": "7a003d9e-81dd-45dc-b08a-9de26b3b6ee7/2024-12-24/77bcd1dd-0b5c-4a14-8122-c86134716d10_2412.05223v1.pdf", "text": "Document: 2412.05223v1.pdf\nType: application/pdf\nModified: 2024-12-24T20:29:08.349Z\nChunk: 3 of 12\n\n**CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT:**\n\nA handful of \"features\" in their neural networks that are important to producing any given output.
