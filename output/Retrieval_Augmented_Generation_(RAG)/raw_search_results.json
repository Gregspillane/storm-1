Studies have shown that RAG achieves an impressive 15\u201320% improvement in question-answering accuracy compared to traditional models."], "title": "The Power of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): Enhancing ... - Medium", "meta": {"query": "How does Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) combine natural language generation with information retrieval?"}, "citation_uuid": -1}, "https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/retrieval-augmented-generation/": {"url": "https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/retrieval-augmented-generation/", "description": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is the process of optimizing the output of a large language model, so it references an authoritative knowledge base outside of its training data sources before generating a response.

The goal is to create bots that can answer user questions in various contexts by cross-referencing authoritative knowledge sources. Unfortunately, the nature of LLM technology introduces unpredictability in LLM responses. Additionally, LLM training data is static and introduces a cut-off date on the knowledge it has.\nKnown challenges of LLMs include:\n- Presenting false information when it does not have the answer.\n- Presenting out-of-date or generic information when the user expects a specific, current response.\n- Creating a response from non-authoritative sources.\n- Creating inaccurate responses due to terminology confusion, wherein different training sources use the same terminology to talk about different things.", "Chatbot development typically begins using a foundation model. Foundation models (FMs) are API-accessible LLMs trained on a broad spectrum of generalized and unlabeled data. The computational and financial costs of retraining FMs for organization or domain-specific information are high. RAG is a more cost-effective approach to introducing new data to the LLM. It makes generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) technology more broadly accessible and usable.\nCurrent information\nEven if the original training data sources for an LLM are suitable for your needs, it is challenging to maintain relevancy. RAG allows developers to provide the latest research, statistics, or news to the generative models. They can use RAG to connect the LLM directly to live social media feeds, news sites, or other frequently-updated information sources. The LLM can then provide the latest information to the users.\nEnhanced user trust", "Retrieve relevant information\nThe next step is to perform a relevancy search. The user query is converted to a vector representation and matched with the vector databases. For example, consider a smart chatbot that can answer human resource questions for an organization. If an employee searches, \"How much annual leave do I have?\" the system will retrieve annual leave policy documents alongside the individual employee's past leave record. These specific documents will be returned because they are highly-relevant to what the employee has input. The relevancy was calculated and established using mathematical vector calculations and representations.\nAugment the LLM prompt\nNext, the RAG model augments the user input (or prompts) by adding the relevant retrieved data in context. This step uses prompt engineering techniques to communicate effectively with the LLM. The augmented prompt allows the large language models to generate an accurate answer to user queries.\nUpdate external data", "The next question may be\u2014what if the external data becomes stale? To maintain current information for retrieval, asynchronously update the documents and update embedding representation of the documents. You can do this through automated real-time processes or periodic batch processing. This is a common challenge in data analytics\u2014different data-science approaches to change management can be used.\nThe following diagram shows the conceptual flow of using RAG with LLMs.\nWhat is the difference between Retrieval-Augmented Generation and semantic search?\nSemantic search enhances RAG results for organizations wanting to add vast external knowledge sources to their LLM applications. Modern enterprises store vast amounts of information like manuals, FAQs, research reports, customer service guides, and human resource document repositories across various systems. Context retrieval is challenging at scale and consequently lowers generative output quality.", "- Use pre-built connectors to popular data technologies like Amazon Simple Storage Service, SharePoint, Confluence, and other websites.\n- Support a wide range of document formats such as HTML, Word, PowerPoint, PDF, Excel, and text files.\n- Filter responses based on those documents that the end-user permissions allow.\nAmazon also offers options for organizations who want to build more custom generative AI solutions. Amazon SageMaker JumpStart is a ML hub with FMs, built-in algorithms, and prebuilt ML solutions that you can deploy with just a few clicks. You can speed up RAG implementation by referring to existing SageMaker notebooks and code examples.\nGet started with Retrieval-Augmented Generation on AWS by creating a free account today", "Semantic search technologies can scan large databases of disparate information and retrieve data more accurately. For example, they can answer questions such as, \"How much was spent on machinery repairs last year?\u201d by mapping the question to the relevant documents and returning specific text instead of search results. Developers can then use that answer to provide more context to the LLM.\nConventional or keyword search solutions in RAG produce limited results for knowledge-intensive tasks. Developers must also deal with word embeddings, document chunking, and other complexities as they manually prepare their data. In contrast, semantic search technologies do all the work of knowledge base preparation so developers don't have to. They also generate semantically relevant passages and token words ordered by relevance to maximize the quality of the RAG payload.\nHow can AWS support your Retrieval-Augmented Generation requirements?", "You can think of the Large Language Model as an over-enthusiastic new employee who refuses to stay informed with current events but will always answer every question with absolute confidence. Unfortunately, such an attitude can negatively impact user trust and is not something you want your chatbots to emulate!\nRAG is one approach to solving some of these challenges. It redirects the LLM to retrieve relevant information from authoritative, pre-determined knowledge sources. Organizations have greater control over the generated text output, and users gain insights into how the LLM generates the response.\nWhat are the benefits of Retrieval-Augmented Generation?\nRAG technology brings several benefits to an organization's generative AI efforts.\nCost-effective implementation", "RAG allows the LLM to present accurate information with source attribution. The output can include citations or references to sources. Users can also look up source documents themselves if they require further clarification or more detail. This can increase trust and confidence in your generative AI solution.\nMore developer control\nWith RAG, developers can test and improve their chat applications more efficiently. They can control and change the LLM's information sources to adapt to changing requirements or cross-functional usage. Developers can also restrict sensitive information retrieval to different authorization levels and ensure the LLM generates appropriate responses. In addition, they can also troubleshoot and make fixes if the LLM references incorrect information sources for specific questions. Organizations can implement generative AI technology more confidently for a broader range of applications.\nHow does Retrieval-Augmented Generation work?", "What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation?\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is the process of optimizing the output of a large language model, so it references an authoritative knowledge base outside of its training data sources before generating a response. Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on vast volumes of data and use billions of parameters to generate original output for tasks like answering questions, translating languages, and completing sentences. RAG extends the already powerful capabilities of LLMs to specific domains or an organization's internal knowledge base, all without the need to retrain the model. It is a cost-effective approach to improving LLM output so it remains relevant, accurate, and useful in various contexts.\nWhy is Retrieval-Augmented Generation important?", "Without RAG, the LLM takes the user input and creates a response based on information it was trained on\u2014or what it already knows. With RAG, an information retrieval component is introduced that utilizes the user input to first pull information from a new data source. The user query and the relevant information are both given to the LLM. The LLM uses the new knowledge and its training data to create better responses. The following sections provide an overview of the process.\nCreate external data\nThe new data outside of the LLM's original training data set is called external data. It can come from multiple data sources, such as a APIs, databases, or document repositories. The data may exist in various formats like files, database records, or long-form text. Another AI technique, called embedding language models, converts data into numerical representations and stores it in a vector database. This process creates a knowledge library that the generative AI models can understand.", "Amazon Bedrock is a fully-managed service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models\u2014along with a broad set of capabilities\u2014to build generative AI applications while simplifying development and maintaining privacy and security.

Some models incorporate extra steps to improve output, such as the re-ranking of retrieved information, context selection, and fine-tuning.\nImprovements\n[edit]Improvements to the basic process above can be applied at different stages in the RAG flow.\nEncoder\n[edit]These methods center around the encoding of text as either dense or sparse vectors. Sparse vectors, used to encode the identity of a word, are typically dictionary length and contain almost all zeros. Dense vectors, used to encode meaning, are much smaller and contain far fewer zeros. Several enhancements can be made to the way similarities are calculated in the vector stores (databases).\n- Performance can be improved with faster dot products, approximate nearest neighors, or centroid searches.\n- Accuracy can be improved with Late Interactions.[clarification needed]", "[edit]By redesigning the language model with the retriever in mind, a 25-time smaller network can get comparable perplexity as its much larger counterparts. Because it is trained from scratch, this method (Retro) incurs the high cost of training runs that the original RAG scheme avoided. The hypothesis is that by giving domain knowledge during training, Retro needs less focus on the domain and can devote its smaller weight resources only to language semantics. The redesigned language model is shown here.\nIt has been reported that Retro is not reproducible, so modifications were made to make it so. The more reproducible version is called Retro++ and includes in-context RAG.\nChunking\n[edit]Chunking involves various strategies for breaking up the data into vectors so the retriever can find details in it.\nThree types of chunking strategies are:\n- Fixed length with overlap. This is fast and easy. Overlapping consecutive chunks helps to maintain semantic context across chunks.", "[edit]Typically, the data to be referenced is converted into LLM embeddings, numerical representations in the form of large vectors. RAG can be used on unstructured (usually text), semi-structured, or structured data (for example knowledge graphs). These embeddings are then stored in a vector database to allow for document retrieval.\nRetrieval\n[edit]Given a user query, a document retriever is first called to select the most relevant documents that will be used to augment the query. This comparison can be done using a variety of methods, which depend in part on the type of indexing used.\nAugmentation\n[edit]The model feeds this relevant retrieved information into the LLM via prompt engineering of the user's original query. Newer implementations (as of 2023[update]) can also incorporate specific augmentation modules with abilities such as expanding queries into multiple domains and using memory and self-improvement to learn from previous retrievals.\nGeneration", "Retrieval-augmented generation\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that grants generative artificial intelligence models information retrieval capabilities. It modifies interactions with a large language model (LLM) so that the model responds to user queries with reference to a specified set of documents, using this information to augment information drawn from its own vast, static training data. This allows LLMs to use domain-specific and/or updated information. Use cases include providing chatbot access to internal company data or giving factual information only from an authoritative source.\nProcess\n[edit]The RAG process is made up of four key stages. First, all the data must be prepared and indexed for use by the LLM. Thereafter, each query consists of a retrieval, augmentation, and generation phase.\nIndexing", "- Syntax-based chunks can break the document up into sentences. Libraries such as spaCy or NLTK can also help.\n- File format-based chunking. Certain file types have natural chunks built in, and it's best to respect them. For example, code files are best chunked and vectorized as whole functions or classes. HTML files should leave <table> or base64 encoded <img> elements intact. Similar considerations should be taken for pdf files. Libraries such as Unstructured or Langchain can assist with this method.\nChallenges\n[edit]If the external data source is large, retrieval can be slow.

Retrieval augmented generation overcomes this by integrating a retrieval mechanism that pulls in relevant data from external sources, allowing the model to generate responses that are both accurate and contextually appropriate. This makes it a superior choice for applications where precision is critical.\nHow RAG works: A deep dive\nThe retrieval process", "Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG, is an advanced AI technique that enhances the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources. Unlike traditional LLMs that rely solely on pre-trained data, RAG pulls in real-time, relevant information from external databases during the content generation process. This blend of generation and retrieval allows RAG to produce more accurate, context-aware responses that go beyond the limitations of standard LLMs.\nThe evolution of AI and LLMs leading to RAG\nAI has come a long way since the early days of rule-based systems. The introduction of machine learning and, later, deep learning, allowed models to learn patterns from vast amounts of data. However, even the most sophisticated LLMs, like GPT models, can struggle with generating factually accurate or contextually relevant responses because they\u2019re limited to the information they were trained on.", "At the core of RAG is its retrieval mechanism. When a query is made, RAG first identifies relevant documents or data from a connected database. This step is crucial because it determines the quality of the information that will augment the model\u2019s generated response. The retrieval process involves sophisticated algorithms designed to sift through large volumes of data quickly and accurately, ensuring that only the most relevant information is used.\nAugmenting LLMs with external knowledge\nOnce the relevant data is retrieved, it\u2019s fed into the LLM, which uses this information to generate a response. This augmentation process allows the model to incorporate fresh, external knowledge into its output, significantly enhancing the relevance and accuracy of the response. Essentially, the LLM acts as a creative engine, while the retrieval system ensures that the output is grounded in reality.\nKey components of a RAG system", "While fine-tuning involves adjusting the parameters of an LLM to improve its performance on specific tasks, RAG takes a different approach by incorporating external data in real-time. This allows RAG to maintain a broader context and provide more accurate responses.\nRAG vs. prompt engineering\nPrompt engineering focuses on crafting the input to an LLM to elicit the desired output. In contrast, retrieval augmented generation enhances the model\u2019s ability to generate accurate content by augmenting it with external knowledge.

The goal is to return relevant document chunks by comparing the query vector with stored chunk vectors in the index (vector store). The retriever\u2019s role is to identify and return the IDs of relevant document chunks, without storing documents. Various search methods can be used, such as similarity search (based on cosine similarity) and threshold-based retrieval, which only returns documents exceeding a certain similarity score.

According to a study, generative AI models can exhibit systematic gender and racial biases, subtly influencing facial expressions and appearances in generated images. This bias is not just confined to the realm of image generation but extends to various applications of AI, including recruitment tools, facial recognition systems, credit scoring, and healthcare diagnostics. For instance, consider the case of a job search platform that was found to offer higher positions more frequently to men of lower qualification than women. While companies may not necessarily hire these men, the model\u2019s biased output could potentially influence the hiring process. Similarly, an algorithm designed to predict the likelihood of a convicted criminal reoffending was questioned for its potential racial and socioeconomic bias.\nUnderstanding the Factors Behind Bias in Generative AI", "Incorporating human-in-the-loop systems is another essential component of this holistic approach.

Do I qualify?", "Linguistic bias occurs when the LLM generative AI favors certain linguistic styles, vocabularies or cultural references over others. This can result in the AI generating content that is more relatable to certain language groups or cultures while alienating others. Data scientists should work to ensure that the AI model remains linguistically neutral and adapts to various language styles and cultural nuances.\nAnchoring bias occurs when an AI model relies too heavily on the initial information it receives. This could lead to the model incorporating early biases present in the training data and perpetuating them throughout its generated content. Data scientists must carefully curate the initial information provided to the model and continuously monitor its outputs to prevent this bias from taking hold.", "My doctoral study on big data governance provides some guidance for data scientists and technology leaders wanting to harness generative AI from LLMs. The study emphasizes the importance of implementing robust governance mechanisms for big data, which serves as the foundation for these LLM and generative AI models. By creating transparent guidelines for data collection, data scientists can actively identify and minimize biases in the training data.\nConclusion\nLLM generative AI offers transformative potential across industries, yet biases pose significant risks. Adhering to ethical AI development principles is paramount. Biases built into the models can affect content generation, emphasizing the need for inclusive datasets, robust governance and vigilant evaluation.", "Group attribution bias emerges when the generative AI attributes specific characteristics or behaviors to an entire group based on the actions of a few individuals. For example, the AI might associate negative attributes with specific ethnicities or genders, perpetuating harmful generalizations and prejudices. To avoid this, LLM models must be trained on diverse datasets that reflect the complexities and individuality of different groups.\nContextual bias arises when the LLM model struggles to understand or interpret the context of a conversation or prompt accurately. Misunderstanding the context can lead to the generation of inappropriate or misleading responses. Data scientists need to fine-tune the model and carefully curate their prompts to better comprehend the context and avoid generating content that is contextually inappropriate or biased.", "The availability bias in an LLM can create information bubbles and echo chambers that simply reinforce existing biases rather than fostering diverse perspectives. It can also lead to misinformation on a given topic if that misinformation is more readily available than factual content. This phenomenon can exacerbate social divisions and undermine the objective and balanced dissemination of knowledge.\nConfirmation bias is a psychological tendency in which individuals seek information that confirms their existing beliefs while ignoring evidence that challenges them. This can be demonstrated either in the training data or in the way that the prompt is written to which the generative AI will develop a response.\nWhen users seek information on a particular subject, the AI might selectively generate content that reinforces their viewpoints, leading to a reinforcement loop where users only encounter information that confirms their existing biases.", "Selection bias emerges when the training data is not representative of the entire population or target audience. If certain groups or perspectives are underrepresented or excluded from the training data, the AI model will lack the necessary knowledge to generate unbiased and comprehensive content.\nFor example, if the training data primarily comprises data from Western countries, the AI may struggle to produce accurate and culturally relevant content for non-Western audiences. This omission perpetuates societal inequalities and prevents the AI system from being an inclusive and unbiased information source.", "Prudent utilization of LLM generative AI demands an understanding of potential biases. Here are several biases that can emerge during the training and deployment of generative AI systems.\nMachine bias refers to the biases that are present in the training data used to build LLMs. Since these models learn from vast human-generated datasets, they tend to absorb the biases present in the text, perpetuating stereotypes and discriminations. Biases pertaining to race, gender, ethnicity and socioeconomic status can inadvertently be perpetuated by the AI system, leading to biased outputs.\nAvailability bias stems from the fact that LLM generative AI models are exposed to large amounts of publicly available data. As a result, the model is more likely to favor content that is more readily available while neglecting perspectives and information that are less prevalent online.", "Automation bias refers to the tendency of humans to blindly trust AI-generated outputs without critically evaluating them. This is one of the most concerning biases when discussing generative AI, as it causes individuals to place unwarranted trust in AI systems, assuming they are infallible.\nWhen relying on LLM generative AI for professional use, it is crucial for data scientists and users to exercise skepticism and independently verify the generated content to avoid propagating false or biased information. Blindly accepting AI-generated content without scrutiny can lead to the dissemination of false or biased information, further amplifying existing biases in society.", "Dr. Knapton is a veteran CIO/CTO, currently CIO of Progrexion.

Let\u2019s explore how RAG is taking our information retrieval to the next level.\nWhat Exactly is RAG?", "- Retrieve all relevant data: Retrieval involves scanning a vast knowledge base which can be internal or external to find documents or information that closely match the user\u2019s query. The data can be retrieved from a variety of sources, including internal manuals/ documents, structured databases, unstructured text documents, APIs, or even the web. The system uses advanced algorithms, often leveraging techniques like semantic search or vector-based retrieval, to identify the most relevant pieces of information. This ensures that the system has access to accurate and contextually appropriate data, which can then be used to generate more informed and precise responses during the subsequent generation phase.", "Imagine an over-eager new team member who\u2019s always confident but often out of touch with the latest updates. This scenario can erode trust. And this is where Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) comes in. RAG helps by allowing the LLM to pull in fresh, relevant information from trusted sources. Instead of relying solely on static training data, RAG directs the AI to retrieve real-time data, ensuring responses are accurate and up-to-date. It gives organizations better control over what\u2019s being communicated and helps users see how the AI arrives at its answers, making the whole experience more reliable and insightful.\nTypes of RAG:\n- Basic RAG: Basic RAG focuses on retrieving information from available sources, such as a predefined set of documents or a basic knowledge base. It then uses a language model to generate answers based on this retrieved information.", "- Application: This approach works well for straightforward tasks, like answering common customer inquiries or generating responses based on static content.

Pre-retrieval strategies like metadata filtering and text chunking can help improve the retrieval efficiency and relevance by narrowing down the search space and ensuring only the most relevant sections of data are considered. Employing more advanced retrieval techniques, such as hybrid search, which combines the strengths of similarity search with keyword search, can also yield more robust retrieval results.

Verba is a multifunctional tool that can be used as a playground for testing and experimenting with RAG pipelines as well as for personal tasks like assisting with research, analyzing internal documents, and streamlining various RAG-related tasks.\nRAG techniques\nThe vanilla RAG workflow is generally composed of an external data source embedded in a vector database retrieved via similarity search. However, there are several ways to enhance RAG workflows to yield more accurate and robust results, which collectively are referred to as advanced RAG.", "By submitting, I agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.", "In this article, we introduced you to RAG, a framework that leverages task-specific external knowledge to improve the performance of applications powered by generative models. We learned about the different components of RAG pipelines, including external knowledge sources, prompt templates, and generative models as well as how they work together in retrieval, augmentation, and generation. We also discussed popular RAG use cases and frameworks for implementation, such as LangChain, LlamaIndex, and DSPy. Finally, we touched on some specialized RAG techniques, including advanced RAG methods, agentic RAG, and graph RAG as well as methods for evaluating RAG pipelines.", "The beauty of RAG lies in the fact that the weights of the underlying generative model don\u2019t need to be updated, which can be costly and time-consuming. RAG allows models to access external data dynamically, improving accuracy without costly retraining. This makes it a practical solution for applications needing real-time information. In the next section, we\u2019ll dive deeper into the architecture of RAG and how its components work together to create a powerful retrieval-augmented system.\nSummary", "The final component in RAG is the generative LLM, or generative model, which is used to generate a final response to the user\u2019s query. The augmented prompt, enriched with information from the external knowledge base, is sent to the model, which generates a response that combines the model's internal knowledge with the newly retrieved data.\nNow that we\u2019ve covered the RAG architecture and its key components, let\u2019s see how they come together in a RAG workflow.\nHow does RAG work?\nRAG is a multi-step framework that works in two stages. First, the external knowledge is preprocessed and prepared for retrieval during the ingestion stage. Next, during the inference stage, the model retrieves relevant data from the external knowledge base, augments it with the user\u2019s prompt, and generates a response. Now, let\u2019s take a closer look at each of these stages.\nStage 1: Ingestion", "Content recommendation systems analyze user data and preferences to suggest relevant products or content to users. Traditionally, these systems required sophisticated ensemble models and massive user preference datasets. RAG simplifies recommendation systems directly integrating external, contextually relevant user data with the model's general knowledge, allowing it to generate personalized recommendations.\nPersonal AI assistants\nOur personal data, including files, emails, Slack messages, and notes are a valuable source of data for generative models. Running RAG over our personal data enables us to interact with it in a conversational way, increasing efficiency and allowing for the automation of mundane tasks. With AI assistants, such as Microsoft\u2019s Copilot and Notion\u2019s Ask AI, we can use simple prompts to search for relevant documents, write personalized emails, summarize documents and meeting notes, schedule meetings, and more.\nHow to implement RAG", "In this article, we take a deep dive into Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), a framework that enhances the capabilities of generative models by allowing them to reference external data. We\u2019ll explore the limitations of generative models that led to the creation of RAG, explain how RAG works, and break down the architecture behind RAG pipelines. We\u2019ll also get practical and outline some real-world RAG use cases, suggest concrete ways to implement RAG, introduce you to a few advanced RAG techniques, and discuss RAG evaluation methods.", "The inference stage starts with retrieval, in which data is retrieved from an external knowledge source in relation to a user query. Retrieval methods vary in format and complexity, however in the naive RAG schema, in which external knowledge is embedded and stored in a vector database, similarity search is the simplest form of retrieval.\nTo perform similarity search, the user query must be first embedded in the same multi-dimensional space as the external data, which allows for direct comparison between the query and embedded external data. During similarity search, the distance between the query and external data points is calculated, returning those with the shortest distance and completing the retrieval process.\nAugmentation\nOnce the most relevant data points from the external data source have been retrieved, the augmentation process integrates this external information by inserting it into a predefined prompt template.\nGeneration", "RAG is only one of several methods to expand the capabilities and mitigate the limitations of generative LLMs. Fine-tuning LLMs is a particularly popular technique for tailoring models to perform highly specialized tasks by training them on domain-specific data. While fine-tuning may be ideal for certain use cases, such as training a LLM to adopt a specific tone or writing style, RAG is often the lowest-hanging fruit for improving model accuracy, reducing hallucinations, and tailoring LLMs for specific tasks.", "RAG evaluation frameworks offer structured methods, tools, or platforms to evaluate RAG pipelines. RAGAS (Retrieval Augmented Generation Assessment) is an especially popular framework, as it offers a suite of metrics to assess retrieval relevance, generation quality, and faithfulness without requiring human-labeled data. Listen to this episode of the Weaviate podcast to learn more about how RAGAS works and advanced techniques for optimizing RAGAS scores, straight from the creators themselves.\nRAG vs. fine-tuning", "Prompt templates provide a structured way to generate standardized prompts, in which various queries and contexts can be inserted. In a RAG pipeline, relevant data is retrieved from an external data source and inserted into prompt templates, thus augmenting the prompt. Essentially, prompt templates act as the bridge between the external data and the model, providing the model with contextually relevant information during inference to generate an accurate response.\nprompt_template = \"Context information is below.\\n\"\n\"---------------------\\n\"\n\"{context_str}\\n\"\n\"---------------------\\n\"\n\"Given the context information and not prior knowledge, \"\n\"answer the query.\\n\"\n\"Query: {query_str}\\n\"\n\"Answer: \"\nGenerative large language model (LLM)", "Popular sources of external data include internal company databases, legal codes and documents, medical and scientific literature, and scraped webpages. Private data sources can be used in RAG as well. Personal AI assistants, like Microsoft\u2019s Copilot, leverage multiple sources of personal data including, emails, documents, and instant messages to provide tailored responses and automate tasks more efficiently.\nPrompt template\nPrompts are the tools we use to communicate our requests to generative models. Prompts may contain several elements, but generally include a query, instructions, and context that guides the model in generating a relevant response.", "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework that augments the general knowledge of a generative LLM by providing it with additional data relevant to the task at hand retrieved from an external data source.\nExternal data sources can include internal databases, files, and repositories, as well as publicly available data such as news articles, websites, or other online content. Access to this data empowers the model to respond more factually, cite its sources in its responses, and avoid \u201cguessing\u201d when prompted about information not found in the model\u2019s original training dataset.\nCommon use cases for RAG include retrieving up-to-date information, accessing specialized domain knowledge, and answering complex, data-driven queries.\nRAG architecture", "After the augmented prompt is injected into the model\u2019s context window, it proceeds to generate the final response to the user\u2019s prompt. In the generation phase, the model combines both its internal language understanding and the augmented external data to produce a coherent, contextually appropriate answer.\nThis step involves crafting the response in a fluent, natural manner while drawing on the enriched information to ensure that the output is both accurate and relevant to the user's query. While augmentation is about incorporating external facts, generation is about transforming that combined knowledge into a well-formed, human-like output tailored to the specific request.\nRAG use cases", "First, the external knowledge source needs to be prepared. Essentially, the external data needs to be cleaned and transformed into a format that the model can understand. This is called the ingestion stage. During ingestion, text or image data is transformed from its raw format into embeddings through a process called vectorization. Once embeddings are generated, they need to be stored in a manner that allows them to be retrieved at a later time. Most commonly, these embeddings are stored in a vector database, which allows for quick, efficient retrieval of the information for downstream tasks.\nStage 2: Inference\nAfter external data is encoded and stored, it\u2019s ready to be retrieved during inference, when the model generates a response or answers a question. Inference is broken down into three steps: retrieval, augmentation, and generation.\nRetrieval", "LLM is a broad term that refers to language models trained on large datasets that are capable of performing a variety of text- and language-related tasks. LLMs that generate novel text in response to a user prompt, like those used in chatbots, are called generative LLMs, or generative models. LLMs that encode text data in the semantic space are called embedding models. Thus, we use the terms generative model and embedding model to distinguish between these two types of models in this article.\nLimitations of generative models\nGenerative models are trained on large datasets, including (but not limited to) social media posts, books, scholarly articles and scraped webpages, allowing them to acquire a sense of general knowledge. As a result, these models can generate human-like text, respond to diverse questions, and assist with tasks like answering, summarizing, and creative writing.", "However, training datasets for generative models are inevitably incomplete, as they lack information on niche topics and new developments beyond the dataset\u2019s cutoff date. Generative models also lack access to proprietary data from internal databases or repositories. Furthermore, when these models don\u2019t know the answer to a question, they often guess, and sometimes not very well. This tendency to generate incorrect or fabricated information in a convincing manner is known as hallucination, and can cause real reputational damage in client-facing AI applications.\nThe key to enhancing performance on specialized tasks and reducing hallucinations is to provide generative models with additional information not found in their training data. This is where RAG comes in.\nWhat is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)?", "While traditional RAG excels at simple question answering tasks that can be resolved by retrieval alone, it is unable to answer questions and draw conclusions over an entire external knowledge base. Graph RAG aims to solve this by using a generative model to create a knowledge graph that extracts and stores the relationships between key entities and can then be added as a data source to the RAG pipeline. This enables the RAG system to respond to queries asking to compare and summarize multiple documents and data sources.\nFor more information on building graph RAG pipelines, take a look at Microsoft\u2019s GraphRAG package and documentation.\nHow to evaluate RAG\nRAG is a multi-stage, multi-step framework that requires both holistic and granular evaluation. This approach ensures both component-level reliability and high-level accuracy. In this section, we\u2019ll explore both of these evaluation approaches and touch on RAGAS, a popular evaluation framework.\nComponent-level evaluation", "Despite the steady release of increasingly larger and smarter models, state-of-the-art generative large language models (LLMs) still have a big problem: they struggle with tasks that require specialized knowledge. This lack of specialized knowledge can lead to issues like hallucinations, where the model generates inaccurate or fabricated information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps mitigate this by allowing the model to pull in real-time, niche data from external sources, enhancing its ability to provide accurate and detailed responses.\nDespite these limitations, generative models are impactful tools that automate mundane processes, assist us in our everyday work, and enable us to interact with data in new ways. So how can we leverage their broad knowledge while also making them work for our specific use cases? The answer lies in providing generative models with task-specific data.", "The basic parts of a RAG pipeline can be broken down into three components: an external knowledge source, a prompt template, and a generative model. Together, these components enable LLM-powered applications to generate more accurate responses by leveraging valuable task-specific data.\nExternal knowledge source\nWithout access to external knowledge, a generative model is limited to generating responses based only on its parametric knowledge, which is learned during the model training phase. With RAG, we have the opportunity to incorporate external knowledge sources, also referred to as non-parametric knowledge, in our pipeline.\nExternal data sources are often task-specific and likely beyond the scope of the model\u2019s original training data, or its parametric knowledge. Furthermore, they are often stored in vector databases and can vary widely in topic and format.", "For a more in-depth exploration of this topic, check out our blog post on advanced RAG techniques.\nAgentic RAG\nAI agents are autonomous systems that can interpret information, formulate plans, and make decisions. When added to a RAG pipeline, agents can reformulate user queries and re-retrieve more relevant information if initial results are inaccurate or irrelevant. Agentic RAG can also handle more complex queries that require multi-step reasoning, like comparing information across multiple documents, asking follow-up questions, and iteratively adjusting retrieval and generation strategies.\nTo take a closer look at a RAG pipeline that incorporates agents, check out this blog on Agentic RAG.\nGraph RAG", "Now that we\u2019ve covered what RAG is, how it works, and its architecture, let\u2019s explore some practical use cases to see how this framework is applied in real-world scenarios. Augmenting generative LLMs with up-to-date, task-specific data boosts their accuracy, relevance, and ability to handle specialized tasks. Consequently, RAG is widely used for real-time information retrieval, creating content recommendation systems, and building personal AI assistants.\nReal-time information retrieval", "On a component-level, RAG evaluation generally focuses on assessing the quality of the retriever and the generator, as they both play critical roles in producing accurate and relevant responses.\nEvaluation of the retriever centers around accuracy and relevance. In this context, accuracy measures how precisely the retriever selects information that directly addresses the query, while relevance assesses how closely the retrieved data aligns with the specific needs and context of the query.\nOn the other hand, evaluation of the generator focuses on faithfulness and correctness. Faithfulness evaluates whether the response generated by the model accurately represents the information from the relevant documents and checks how consistent the response is with the original sources. Correctness assesses whether the generated response is truly factual and aligns with the ground truth or expected answer based on the query's context.\nEnd-to-end evaluation", "Now that we know how RAG works, let\u2019s explore how to build a functional RAG pipeline. RAG can be implemented through a number of different frameworks, which simplify the building process by providing pre-built tools and modules for integrating individual RAG components as well as external services like vector databases, embedding generation tools, and other APIs.\nLangChain, LlamaIndex, and DSPy are all robust open source Python libraries with highly engaged communities that offer powerful tools and integrations for building and optimizing RAG pipelines and LLM applications.\n- LangChain provides building blocks, components, and third-party integrations to aid in the development of LLM-powered applications.

RAG impressed by outperforming other models in tasks that required a lot of knowledge, like question-answering, and by generating more accurate and varied text. This breakthrough has been embraced and extended by researchers and practitioners and is a powerful tool for building generative AI applications.\nWhether you are a seasoned AI expert or a newcomer to the field, this guide will equip you with the knowledge needed to harness the capabilities of RAG and stay at the forefront of AI innovation.\nAn introduction to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)", "Before the retrieval model can search through the data, it's typically divided into manageable \"chunks\" or segments. This chunking process ensures that the system can efficiently scan through the data and enables quick retrieval of relevant content. Effective chunking strategies can drastically improve the model's speed and accuracy: a document may be its own chunk, but it could also be split up into chapters/sections, paragraphs, sentences, or even just \u201cchunks of words.\u201d Remember: the goal is to be able to feed the Generative Model with information that will enhance its generation.\nText-to-vector conversion (embeddings)", "RAG begins by comprehensively analyzing the user's input. This step involves understanding the intent, context, and specific information requirements of the query. The accuracy of this initial analysis is crucial as it guides the retrieval process to fetch the most relevant external data.\nStep 2: Retrieving external data\nOnce the query is understood, RAG taps into a range of external data sources. These sources could include up-to-date databases, APIs, or extensive document repositories. The goal here is to access a breadth of information that extends beyond the language model's initial training data. This step is vital in ensuring that the response generated is informed by the most current and relevant information available.\nStep 3: Data vectorization for relevancy matching", "In the ever-evolving field of natural language processing (NLP), the quest for more intelligent, context-aware systems is ongoing. This is where retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) comes into the picture, addressing some of the limitations of traditional generative models. So, what drives the increasing adoption of RAG?\nFirstly, RAG provides a solution for generating text that isn't just fluent but also factually accurate and information-rich. By combining retrieval models with generative models, RAG ensures that the text it produces is both well-informed and well-written. Retrieval models bring the \"what\"\u2014the factual content\u2014while generative models contribute the \"how\"\u2014the art of composing these facts into coherent and meaningful language.", "Secondly, the dual nature of RAG offers an inherent advantage in tasks requiring external knowledge or contextual understanding. For instance, in question-answering systems, traditional generative models might struggle to offer precise answers. In contrast, RAG can pull in real-time information through its retrieval component, making its responses more accurate and detailed.\nLastly, scenarios demanding multi-step reasoning or synthesis of information from various sources are where RAG truly shines. Think of legal research, scientific literature reviews, or even complex customer service queries. RAG's capability to search, select, and synthesize information makes it unparalleled in handling such intricate tasks.\nIn summary, RAG's hybrid architecture delivers superior text generation capabilities, making it an ideal choice for applications requiring depth, context, and factual accuracy.", "Exploring the technical implementation of retrieval-augmented generation with large language models (LLMs)\nIf the concept of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has piqued your interest, diving into its technical implementation will offer invaluable insights. With large language models (LLMs) as the backbone, RAG employs intricate processes, from data sourcing to the final output. Let's peel back the layers to uncover the mechanics of RAG and understand how it leverages LLMs to execute its powerful retrieval and generation capabilities.\nSource data", "Retrieval-augmented generation is a technique that enhances traditional language model responses by incorporating real-time, external data retrieval. It starts with the user's input, which is then used to fetch relevant information from various external sources. This process enriches the context and content of the language model's response. By combining the user's query with up-to-date external information, RAG creates responses that are not only relevant and specific but also reflect the latest available data. This approach significantly improves the quality and accuracy of responses in various applications, from chatbots to information retrieval systems.\nNow, let's delve into the detailed steps of how RAG operates:\nStep 1: Initial query processing", "Once the retrieval model has sourced the appropriate information, generative models come into play. These models act as creative writers, synthesizing the retrieved information into coherent and contextually relevant text. Usually built upon large language models (LLMs), generative models can create text that is grammatically correct, semantically meaningful, and aligned with the initial query or prompt. They take the raw data selected by the retrieval models and give it a narrative structure, making the information easily digestible and actionable. In the RAG framework, generative models serve as the final piece of the puzzle, providing the textual output we interact with.\nWhy is retrieval-augmented generation important?", "Synergy of retrieval and generative models\nThough we'll delve into more technical details in a later section, it's worth noting how RAG marries retrieval and generative models. In a nutshell, the retrieval model acts as a specialized 'librarian,' pulling in relevant information from a database or a corpus of documents. This information is then fed to the generative model, which acts as a 'writer,' crafting coherent and informative text based on the retrieved data. The two work in tandem to provide answers that are not only accurate but also contextually rich. For a deeper understanding of generative models like LLMs, you may want to explore our guide on large language models.\nStep by step on how retrieval-augmented generation works", "What is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)?\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technique that combines information retrieval with text generation, allowing AI models to retrieve relevant information from a knowledge source and incorporate it into generated text.\nIn the dynamic landscape of artificial intelligence, Retrieval-augmented generation has emerged as a game-changer, revolutionizing the way we generate and interact with text. RAG seamlessly marries the power of information retrieval with natural language generation using tools like large language models (LLMs), offering a transformative approach to content creation.\nOrigins and evolution of retrieval-augmented generation", "Retrieval-augmented generation, commonly known as RAG, has been making waves in the realm of natural language processing (NLP). At its core, RAG is a hybrid framework that integrates retrieval models and generative models to produce text that is not only contextually accurate but also information-rich.\nSignificance in natural language processing (NLP)\nThe significance of RAG in NLP cannot be overstated. Traditional language models, especially early ones, could generate text based on the data they were trained on but could not often source additional, specific information during the generation process. RAG fills this gap effectively, creating a bridge between the wide-ranging capabilities of retrieval models and the text-generating prowess of generative models, such as large language models (LLMs). By doing so, RAG pushes the boundaries of what is possible in NLP, making it an indispensable tool for tasks like question-answering, summarization, and much more.", "The starting point of any RAG system is its source data, often consisting of a vast corpus of text documents, websites, or databases. This data serves as the knowledge reservoir that the retrieval model scans through to find relevant information. It's crucial to have diverse, accurate, and high-quality source data for optimal functioning. It is also important to manage and reduce redundancy in the source data\u2014for example, software documentation between version 1 and version 1.1 will be almost entirely identical to each other.\nData chunking", "Retrieval models act as the information gatekeepers in the RAG architecture. Their primary function is to search through a large corpus of data to find relevant pieces of information that can be used for text generation. Think of them as specialized librarians who know exactly which 'books' to pull off the 'shelves' when you ask a question. These models use algorithms to rank and select the most pertinent data, offering a way to introduce external knowledge into the text generation process. By doing so, retrieval models set the stage for more informed, context-rich language generation, elevating the capabilities of traditional language models.\nRetrieval models can be implemented through several mechanisms. One of the most common techniques is through the use of vector embeddings and vector search, but also commonly used are document indexing databases that utilize technologies like BM25 (Best Match 25) and TF-IDF (Term Frequency\u2014Inverse Document Frequency).\nGenerative models", "The link between the source data and embeddings is the linchpin of the RAG architecture. A well-orchestrated match between them ensures that the retrieval model fetches the most relevant information, which in turn informs the generative model to produce meaningful and accurate text. In essence, this link facilitates the seamless integration between the retrieval and generative components, making the RAG model a unified system.\nIf you need a place to keep text documents to use in RAG solutions, you need a vector database! Vector Search on Astra DB is now available. Learn more here!", "The next step involves converting the textual data into a format that the model can readily use. When using a vector database, this means transforming the text into mathematical vectors via a process known as \u201cembedding\u201d. These are almost always generated using complex software models that have been built with machine learning techniques. These vectors encapsulate the semantics and context of the text, making it easier for the retrieval model to identify relevant data points. Many embedding models can be fine-tuned to create good semantic matching; general-purpose embedding models such as GPT and LLaMa may not perform as well against scientific information as a model like SciBERT, for example.\nLinks between source data and embeddings", "To maintain the efficacy of the RAG system, the external data sources are regularly updated. This ensures that the system's responses remain relevant over time. The update process can be automated or done in periodic batches, depending on the nature of the data and the application's requirements. This aspect of RAG highlights the importance of data dynamism and freshness in generating accurate and useful responses.\nKey components of retrieval-augmented generation\nUnderstanding the inner workings of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) requires a deep dive into its two foundational elements: retrieval models and generative models. These two components are the cornerstones of RAG's remarkable capability to source, synthesize, and generate information-rich text. Let's unpack what each of these models brings to the table and what synergies they bring in a RAG framework.\nRetrieval models", "The external data, along with the user query, is transformed into numerical vector representations. This conversion is a critical part of the process, as it enables the system to perform complex mathematical calculations to determine the relevancy of the external data to the user's query. The precision in this matching process directly influences the quality and relevance of the information retrieved.\nStep 4: Augmentation of language model prompts\nWith the relevant external data identified, the next step involves augmenting the language model's prompt with this information. This augmentation is more than just adding data; it involves integrating the new information in a way that maintains the context and flow of the original query. This enhanced prompt allows the language model to generate responses that are not only contextually rich but also grounded in accurate and up-to-date information.\nStep 5: Ongoing data updates"], "title": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Guide: What is RAG? - DataStax", "meta": {"query": "Key components of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)"}, "citation_uuid": -1}, "https://medium.com/@yashraj.26/rig-vs-rag-in-ai-a-comparative-overview-848c75a905d1": {"url": "https://medium.com/@yashraj.26/rig-vs-rag-in-ai-a-comparative-overview-848c75a905d1", "description": "RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation, is a hybrid approach that enhances text generation models by incorporating information from external knowledge sources.

Understanding RIG: Retrieval-Integrated Generation\nWhat is RIG?\nRIG, or Retrieval-Integrated Generation, is a closely related concept but differs in how retrieval and generation are blended. Instead of treating retrieval and generation as distinct steps, RIG integrates them more tightly, allowing for a dynamic interplay between the retrieval process and the generative model throughout the response generation phase.\nHow RIG Works:\n- Retrieval-Informed Generation: Rather than retrieving information once and feeding it to the model, RIG systems allow the generative process to actively query the retrieval system as needed during generation. This creates a more dynamic interaction between retrieval and generation, with the generative model continuously fetching relevant data while producing the response.", "- Integrated Pipeline: In RIG, the retrieval and generation components are deeply intertwined, and the generative model may issue multiple queries to the retrieval system as it refines its output.\nBenefits of RIG:\n- Dynamic Querying: RIG can fetch and integrate information at various stages of the generation process, making it more flexible in handling complex or evolving queries.\n- Increased Relevance: By allowing the generative model to access specific data at multiple points, RIG ensures that the final output remains relevant to the user\u2019s query.\n- Fine-Tuned Information: RIG\u2019s tight coupling between retrieval and generation enables it to produce responses that are more responsive to nuanced or multi-step queries.\nUse Cases:\n- Conversational AI: For chatbots or virtual assistants handling complex, multi-turn dialogues, RIG can continuously access relevant information throughout the conversation to ensure coherent and contextually appropriate responses.", "RIG vs RAG in AI: A Comparative Overview\nIn the realm of AI-driven applications, especially those leveraging language models for tasks like text generation, information retrieval, and question answering, two approaches are often discussed: RIG (Retrieval-Integrated Generation) and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). These methods integrate retrieval mechanisms with generative models to improve both accuracy and relevance, but they operate on different principles and target slightly different use cases. Let\u2019s explore these concepts in detail and compare how they shape modern AI solutions.\n1. Understanding RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation\nWhat is RAG?", "RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation, is a hybrid approach that enhances text generation models by incorporating information from external knowledge sources. It operates by first retrieving relevant documents from a large corpus and then feeding this information into a generative model, like a Transformer-based language model, to produce more contextually relevant outputs.\nHow RAG Works:\n- Retrieval Step: Given an input query, the system searches for relevant documents or information from a pre-built knowledge base or database.\n- Augmentation Step: The retrieved documents are combined with the original input to enhance the context. This augmented input is then passed to the generative model.\n- Generation Step: The model generates a response or output that integrates both the retrieved information and the original input, producing answers or content that is more accurate and contextually enriched.\nBenefits of RAG:", "- Context-Rich Generation: By leveraging external data, RAG can handle questions or tasks requiring specific, up-to-date knowledge that the language model itself might not contain.\n- Reduced Hallucination: Traditional language models sometimes generate plausible but incorrect information. RAG mitigates this by grounding the generation process in real, retrievable data.\n- Scalability: As new information is available, updating the retrieval corpus ensures the model stays relevant without retraining the generative part.\nUse Cases:\n- Open-Domain Question Answering: RAG is ideal for tasks like answering factual questions where the model needs to refer to specific documents or databases.\n- Personal Assistants: By integrating user-specific data (e.g., emails or documents), RAG can generate personalized responses.\n- Content Creation: In knowledge-heavy domains, RAG can assist in creating detailed reports or articles by pulling in relevant research data.", "- When to Use RIG: RIG shines in more dynamic, conversational settings or scenarios where multiple rounds of retrieval are necessary. For instance, in long conversations where the context changes over time or in complex report generation where new data may need to be integrated throughout the output, RIG\u2019s ability to continuously retrieve information is advantageous.\nConclusion\nBoth RAG and RIG represent powerful advancements in AI, enabling models to go beyond static knowledge and tap into external information repositories in real time. While RAG is well-suited for applications that require a one-time retrieval followed by context-aware generation, RIG\u2019s dynamic approach allows for more intricate and evolving query handling. As AI continues to evolve, these retrieval-enhanced generative models will play a critical role in creating smarter, more accurate, and more responsive systems across various domains.", "- Complex Report Generation: When generating long-form content, RIG can retrieve data as needed to adapt the output in real-time, improving accuracy and detail.\n3. RIG vs. RAG: Key Differences\n4. Choosing Between RIG and RAG\nThe choice between RIG and RAG depends largely on the nature of the application and the complexity of the queries being handled.\n- When to Use RAG: If the task involves fact-based question answering or requires the generation of content grounded in a large, static corpus (like encyclopedic knowledge or a specific domain), RAG is an excellent choice. It\u2019s ideal for applications that don\u2019t require constant back-and-forth between the retrieval and generation processes but still benefit from context-enriched outputs."], "title": "RIG vs RAG in AI: A Comparative Overview - Medium", "meta": {"query": "Difference between Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and natural language generation techniques"}, "citation_uuid": -1}, "https://blog.ailab.sh/2024/09/exploring-difference-between-retrieval.html": {"url": "https://blog.ailab.sh/2024/09/exploring-difference-between-retrieval.html", "description": "Key Differences Between RIG and RAG.

The generative model relies on this external data to enrich its outputs.\nThis retrieval-based method allows the model to access real-time information or large amounts of specialized knowledge that may not be encoded within the model itself, especially when it comes to niche topics or factual accuracy.\nAdvantages of RAG:\n- Improved Accuracy: By pulling in external documents, RAG ensures the information is more factual and up-to-date.\n- Scalability: It works well with large databases of domain-specific knowledge, making it suitable for applications like customer support or technical documentations.\n- Flexibility: The retrieval source can be updated independently, keeping the system more agile.", "On the other hand, if you need a more sophisticated system that can evolve its understanding of a query over time, especially in interactive or conversational settings, RIG is the better option. Its iterative nature allows for more nuanced and coherent responses, even in the face of evolving questions or complex topics.\nBoth techniques enhance LLMs by incorporating external knowledge, but the core difference lies in how they interweave the retrieval and generation processes. By understanding these distinctions, developers and researchers can better choose the approach that suits their needs, pushing the boundaries of what AI-driven text generation can achieve.\nBy mastering both RAG and RIG, you gain powerful tools for crafting more accurate, intelligent, and context-aware AI systems. As AI continues to evolve, these hybrid models will play a crucial role in expanding the capabilities of language models in real-world applications.", "In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence and natural language processing (NLP), techniques for enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) have become critical. Two prominent approaches are Retrieval-Interleaved Generation (RIG) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). While they may sound similar, each technique has its own methodology and use cases. Let\u2019s dive into their differences and understand when and why you would use each.\nWhat is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation is a hybrid approach that combines retrieval mechanisms with generative language models. It enhances the performance of LLMs by incorporating external knowledge to produce more contextually accurate and factual responses. Here\u2019s how it works:\n- Retrieval Phase: During the generation process, RAG retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a database or knowledge source based on the input prompt.", "- Iterative Refinement: This process can be repeated, interleaving retrieval and generation multiple times until the model produces a more polished or informed output.\nIn RIG, the model doesn\u2019t just retrieve once and generate. Instead, it constantly updates its knowledge as it generates more information, leading to richer and more coherent results.\nAdvantages of RIG:\n- Dynamic Knowledge Use: The back-and-forth between retrieval and generation allows the model to refine its outputs iteratively, making it less likely to give inaccurate or irrelevant responses.\n- Enhanced Coherence: Since RIG continuously integrates new information, it helps ensure that responses are logically connected and aligned with the broader context of the conversation.\n- Greater Adaptability: RIG can adapt to complex queries that evolve as the conversation continues, making it suitable for dialogue systems and real-time applications.\nKey Differences Between RIG and RAG", "- RIG is more appropriate for conversational agents or complex tasks where the system needs to refine its understanding and response over time, especially in multi-turn dialogues.\nComplexity:\n- RAG tends to be simpler in terms of architecture and flow because it separates retrieval and generation phases.\n- RIG is more complex since it requires continuous integration of retrieval and generation, making it computationally more expensive but potentially yielding higher quality responses.\nWhich One Should You Choose?\nThe choice between RIG and RAG depends on the specific needs of your application. If you\u2019re working with tasks that require high factual accuracy and don\u2019t involve ongoing, multi-turn conversations, RAG might be sufficient. It\u2019s simpler to implement and provides strong performance when armed with a good knowledge base.", "Interaction Between Retrieval and Generation:\n- In RAG, the retrieval happens only once before the generation, and the generative model uses this static information to generate a response.\n- In RIG, the retrieval and generation processes are interleaved, allowing for multiple iterations of retrieval based on the text being generated.\nContextual Refinement:\n- RAG is more suited for tasks where a one-time retrieval is sufficient to inform the generative model. It excels when the information is static and does not require frequent updating.\n- RIG, on the other hand, allows for continuous refinement, making it better for tasks that require ongoing interaction, clarification, or dynamically evolving contexts.\nUse Case:\n- RAG is ideal for applications such as question-answering systems where the goal is to retrieve relevant information and generate an answer based on that.", "However, RAG comes with limitations. Since the retrieved information is static, there\u2019s no active interaction between the generation and retrieval processes after retrieval. If the retrieved information isn\u2019t ideal, it might lead to poor responses.\nWhat is Retrieval-Interleaved Generation (RIG)?\nRetrieval-Interleaved Generation (RIG) represents a more dynamic and iterative approach to the same challenge: making language models better at leveraging external knowledge. In RIG, the retrieval and generation processes are tightly interwoven, allowing for a more fluid exchange between the retrieval system and the LLM.\nHere\u2019s how RIG works:\n- Initial Generation: The LLM begins by generating an initial sequence or response.\n- Retrieval Phase: Based on this generated text, the system retrieves additional relevant information.\n- Interleaving Process: This new information is fed back into the generative model, allowing it to refine and update its response."], "title": "Exploring the Difference Between Retrieval-Interleaved Generation (RIG ...", "meta": {"query": "Difference between Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and natural language generation techniques"}, "citation_uuid": -1}, "https://thedatafreak.medium.com/rag-retrieval-augmented-generation-30ef429c2e00": {"url": "https://thedatafreak.medium.com/rag-retrieval-augmented-generation-30ef429c2e00", "description": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation vs Semantic Search.

The inclusion of citations or references in the output enables users to verify information independently, fostering confidence in the reliability of the generative AI solution.\nLastly, RAG provides developers with increased control over chat applications. Developers can efficiently test and improve applications, adapt the LLM\u2019s information sources to changing requirements, and manage sensitive information retrieval at different authorization levels. This level of control ensures that the LLM generates appropriate responses and allows for troubleshooting and fixes, enabling organizations to implement generative AI technology confidently across diverse applications.\nHow RAG Works", "- Semantic Search: Semantic search is commonly used in search engines and information retrieval systems to provide more accurate and contextually relevant results. It is widely applied in web search, document retrieval, and other information retrieval applications.\nGeneration vs. Retrieval:\n- RAG: RAG emphasizes the generation aspect, combining the generative capabilities of LLMs with the retrieval of external information to produce a comprehensive and contextually informed response.\n- Semantic Search: Semantic search is focused on retrieving information based on the meaning of the query, without the emphasis on generating new content. It aims to find existing documents or data that match the user\u2019s intent.\nUser Interaction:\n- RAG: RAG is often used in interactive systems where the model generates responses to user queries. The model can incorporate real-time information from external sources to provide up-to-date and relevant answers.", "\u201cQuestions are never indiscreet, answers sometimes are.\u201d \u2014 Oscar Wilde\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) involves enhancing the output of a substantial language model by incorporating references from an authoritative knowledge base external to its training data sources before producing a response. Large Language Models (LLMs) undergo training on extensive datasets, employing billions of parameters to generate original content for tasks such as answering questions, language translation, and sentence completion. RAG expands upon the already formidable capabilities of LLMs by tailoring them to specific domains or an organization\u2019s internal knowledge base, all without necessitating a retraining of the model. This approach proves to be a cost-effective means of refining LLM output, ensuring its continued relevance, accuracy, and utility across diverse contexts.\nWhy is Retrieval-Augmented Generation important?", "- Semantic Search: Semantic search is typically used in scenarios where users submit queries and expect relevant documents or information in return. It is less focused on generating responses and more on retrieving existing content.\nCreating a Question Answering Bot on Medium Blogs\nI used here langchain with RAG.

Firstly, RAG facilitates cost-effective implementation by mitigating the high computational and financial expenses associated with retraining foundation models (FMs) for organization-specific data. This approach enhances the accessibility and usability of generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) technology.\nSecondly, RAG ensures the currency of information by enabling developers to integrate the latest research, statistics, or news into generative models. By connecting the Large Language Model (LLM) directly to live social media feeds, news sites, or other frequently updated sources, RAG allows the LLM to deliver the most recent information to users, addressing the challenge of maintaining relevance.", "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technology that enhances the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating retrieval mechanisms to access external knowledge sources during the generation of responses. Here\u2019s a simplified explanation of how Retrieval-Augmented Generation works:\n- Large Language Models (LLMs): RAG builds upon existing LLMs, which are powerful models trained on vast datasets to generate human-like text. These models are proficient in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as answering questions and completing sentences.\n- Knowledge Base Integration: RAG introduces a knowledge base, which is a repository of external information, into the generation process. This knowledge base typically contains authoritative and domain-specific data relevant to the tasks the LLM is designed for.", "A fitting analogy for the Large Language Model is that of an excessively enthusiastic new employee who, despite confidently answering every question, remains uninformed about current events. Regrettably, such an approach can erode user trust and is not a trait desirable for chatbots to emulate.\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) emerges as a solution to address some of these challenges. RAG directs the LLM to retrieve pertinent information from pre-established, authoritative knowledge sources. This strategy provides organizations with increased control over the generated text output, offering users transparency into the LLM\u2019s response-generation process.\nBenefits of RAG", "- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): The primary goal of RAG is to enhance the generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating retrieval mechanisms that access external knowledge sources. RAG combines the generative power of LLMs with the ability to retrieve and incorporate information from a predefined knowledge base during the response generation process.\n- Semantic Search: Semantic search, on the other hand, is primarily concerned with improving the accuracy and relevance of search results by understanding the meaning (semantics) behind user queries. It focuses on matching the intent and context of the query with the content of documents or data in a database.\nApplication and Use Cases\n- RAG: RAG is commonly applied in tasks such as question-answering systems, chatbots, and content generation where the model needs to generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses by retrieving and incorporating information from external sources.", "- Source Attribution: RAG often includes mechanisms for source attribution, allowing the model to indicate the origin of the information in the generated response. This transparency can enhance user trust by providing visibility into the model\u2019s decision-making process.\n- Adaptability and Fine-Tuning: RAG allows for adaptability and fine-tuning by enabling developers to adjust the knowledge base or refine the retrieval mechanism based on changing requirements, emerging data, or evolving contexts. This ensures that the model remains up-to-date and aligned with the organization\u2019s goals.\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation vs Semantic Search\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and semantic search are related concepts but have distinct focuses and functionalities in the field of natural language processing.

This approach can be more efficient than full reindexing, especially for large datasets.\n- Delta encoding: Store only the differences between the existing documents and their updated versions. This approach reduces the data processing load by avoiding the need to process unchanged data.\n- Versioning:\n- Snapshotting: Maintain document corpus versions at different points in time. This technique provides a backup mechanism and allows the system to revert or refer to previous versions.\n- Document version control: Use a version control system to systematically track document changes for maintaining the change history and simplifying the update process.\n- Real-time updates:\n- Stream processing: When information timeliness is critical, utilize stream processing technologies for real-time vector database updates as document changes are made.", "This article outlined several processes aimed at mitigating the possibility that the RAG-based chat system could be exploited or compromised. Red-teaming plays a crucial role in ensuring the mitigations are effective. Red-teaming involves simulating an adversary's actions aimed at the application to uncover potential weaknesses or vulnerabilities. This approach is especially vital in addressing the significant risk of jailbreaking.\nDevelopers need to rigorously assess RAG-based chat system safeguards under various guideline scenarios to effectively test and verify them. This not only ensures robustness but also helps in fine-tuning the system\u2019s responses to adhere strictly to defined ethical standards and operational procedures.\nFinal considerations that might influence your application design decisions\nHere's a short list of things to consider and other takeaways from this article that affect your application design decisions:", "The \"golden dataset\" represents the \"best case scenario\" and enables developers to evaluate the system to see how well it performs, and perform regression tests when implementing new features or updates.\nAssessing harm\nHarms modeling is a methodology aimed at foreseeing potential harms, spotting deficiencies in a product that might pose risks to individuals, and developing proactive strategies to mitigate such risks.\nTo tool designed for assessing the impact of technology, particularly AI systems, would feature several key components based on the principles of harms modeling as outlined in the provided resources.\nKey features of a harms evaluation tool might include:\nStakeholder Identification: The tool would help users identify and categorize various stakeholders affected by the technology, including direct users, indirectly affected parties, and other entities like future generations or nonhuman factors such as environmental concerns (.", "Developers must decide how to break up a longer document into smaller chunks. This can improve the relevance of the supplemental content sent into the LLM to answer the user's query accurately. Furthermore, developers need to consider how to utilize the chunks upon retrieval. This is an area where system designers should do some research on techniques used in the industry, and do some experimentation, even testing it in a limited capacity in their organization.\nDevelopers must consider:\n- Chunk size optimization - Determine what is the ideal size of the chunk, and how to designate a chunk. By section? By paragraph? By sentence?\n- Overlapping and sliding window chunks - Determine how to divide the content into discrete chunks. Or will the chunks overlap? Or both (sliding window)?", "Policy check - This step involves logic that identifies, removes, flags, or rejects certain content. Some examples might include removing personal data, removing expletives, and identifying \"jailbreak\" attempts. Jailbreaking refers to the methods that users might employ to circumvent or manipulate the built-in safety, ethical, or operational guidelines of the model.\nQuery re-writing - This step might be anything from expanding acronyms and removing slang to rephrasing the question to ask it more abstractly to extract high-level concepts and principles (\"step-back prompting\").\nA variation on step-back prompting is hypothetical document embeddings (HyDE) which uses the LLM to answer the user's question, creates an embedding for that response (the hypothetical document embedding), and uses that embedding to perform a search against the vector database.\nSubqueries", "If your organization needs to index documents that are frequently updated, it's essential to maintain an updated corpus to ensure the retriever component (the logic in the system responsible for performing the query against the vector database and returning the results) can access the most current information. Here are some strategies for updating the vector database in such systems:\n- Incremental updates:\n- Regular intervals: Schedule updates at regular intervals (for example, daily, weekly) depending on the frequency of document changes. This method ensures that the database is periodically refreshed.\n- Trigger-based updates: Implement a system where updates trigger reindexing. For instance, any modification or addition of a document could automatically initiate a reindexing of the affected sections.\n- Partial updates:", "Building an assessment pipeline, therefore, becomes essential to manage the scale of these tasks effectively. An efficient pipeline would utilize custom tooling to evaluate metrics that approximate the quality of answers provided by the AI. This system would streamline the process of determining why a specific answer was given to a user's question, which documents were used to generate that answer, and the effectiveness of the inference pipeline that processes the queries.\nGolden dataset\nOne strategy to evaluating the results of a nondeterministic system like a RAG-chat system is to implement a \"golden dataset\". A golden dataset is a curated set of questions with approved answers, metadata (like topic and type of question), references to source documents that can serve as ground truth for answers, and even variations (different phrasings to capture the diversity of how users might ask the same questions).", "- Is the user's query written in such a way to get the results from the system that the user is looking for?\n- Does the user's query violate any of our policies?\n- How do we rewrite the user's query to improve its chances at finding nearest matches in the vector database?\n- How do we evaluate the query results to ensure that the article chunks aligned to the query?\n- How do we evaluate and modify the query results before passing them into the LLM to ensure that the most relevant details are included in the LLM's completion?\n- How do we evaluate the LLM's response to ensure that the LLM's completion answers the user's original query?\n- How do we ensure the LLM's response complies with our policies?\nAs you can see, there are many tasks that developers must take into account, mostly in the form of:\n- Preprocessing inputs to optimize the likelihood of getting the desired results\n- Post-processing outputs to ensure desired results", "Feedback Mechanisms: The tool should incorporate mechanisms for gathering feedback from stakeholders, ensuring that the harms evaluation process is dynamic and responsive to new information and perspectives.\nDocumentation and Reporting: For transparency and accountability, the tool might facilitate detailed reports that document the harms assessment process, findings, and potential risk mitigation actions taken.\nThese features wouldn't only help identify and mitigate risks, but also help in designing more ethical and responsible AI systems by considering a broad spectrum of impacts from the outset.\nFor more information, see:\nTesting and verifying the safeguards", "- Live querying: Instead of relying solely on preindexed vectors, implement a live data query mechanism for up-to-date responses, possibly combining with cached results for efficiency.\n- Optimization techniques:\nBatch processing: Batch process accumulated changes for resource optimization and overhead reduction instead of frequent updates.\nHybrid approaches: Combine various strategies, such as:\n- Using incremental updates for minor changes.\n- Full reindexing for major updates.\n- Document corpus structural changes.\nChoosing the right update strategy or a combination depends on specific requirements such as:\nDocument corpus size.\nUpdate frequency.\nReal-time data needs.\nResource availability.\nEvaluate these factors based on the specific application needs as each approach has complexity, cost, and update latency trade-offs.\nInference pipeline\nNow that the articles are chunked, vectorized, and stored in a vector database, the focus turns to completion challenges.", "Clean and accurate content is one of the best ways to improve the overall quality of a RAG-based chat system. To accomplish this, developers need to start by analyzing the shape and form of the documents to be indexed. Do the documents conform to specified content patterns like documentation? If not, what types of questions might the documents answer?\nAt a minimum, developers should create steps in the ingestion pipeline to:\n- Standardize text formats\n- Handle special characters\n- Remove unrelated, outdated content\n- Account for versioned content\n- Account for content experience (tabs, images, tables)\n- Extract metadata\nSome of this information (like metadata for example) might be useful to be kept with the document in the vector database for use during the retrieval and evaluation process in the inference pipeline, or combined with the text chunk to persuade the chunk's vector embedding.\nChunking strategy", "- Prompt compression - Use a small, inexpensive model to compress and summarize multiple article chunks into a single compressed prompt before sending to the LLM.\nPost-completion processing steps\nPost-completion processing occurs after the user's query and all content chunks are sent to the LLM, as depicted in the following diagram:\nAccuracy validation occurs after prompt completion by the LLM. A post-completion processing pipeline might include the following steps:\n- Fact check - The intent is to identify specific claims made in the article that are presented as facts and then to check those facts for accuracy. If the fact check step fails, it might be appropriate to requery the LLM in hopes of a better answer or return an error message to the user.\n- Policy check - The last line of defense to ensure that answers don't contain harmful content, whether to the user or the organization.\nEvaluation", "- A general health information index for basic queries and public health information.\nIf a user asks a technical question about the biochemical effects of a new drug, the query router might prioritize the medical research paper index due to its depth and technical focus. For a question about typical symptoms of a common illness, however, the general health index might be chosen for its broad and easily understandable content.\nPost-retrieval processing steps\nPost-retrieval processing occurs after the retriever component retrieves relevant content chunks from the vector database as depicted in the diagram:\nWith candidate content chunks retrieved, the next steps are to validate the article chunk usefulness when augmenting the LLM prompt before preparing the prompt to be presented to the LLM.\nDevelopers must consider several prompt aspects:\n- Including too much supplement information might result in ignoring the most important information.", "- including irrelevant information could negatively influence the answer.\nAnother consideration is the needle in a haystack problem, a term that refers to a known quirk of some LLMs where the content at the beginning and end of a prompt have greater weight to the LLM than the content in the middle.\nFinally, the LLM's maximum context window length and the number of tokens required to complete extraordinarily long prompts (especially when dealing with queries at scale) must be considered.\nTo deal with these issues, a post-retrieval processing pipeline might include the following steps:\n- Filtering results - In this step, developers ensure that the article chunks returned by the vector database are relevant to the query. If not, the result is ignored when composing the prompt for the LLM.\n- Re-ranking - Rank the article chunks retrieved from the vector store to ensure relevant details live near the edges (beginning and end) of the prompt.", "Building advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems\nThe previous article discussed two options for building a \"chat over your data\" application, one of the premiere use cases for generative AI in businesses:\n- Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) which supplements a Large Language Model's (LLM) training with a database of searchable articles that can be retrieved based on similarity to the users' queries and passed to the LLM for completion.\n- Fine-tuning, which expands the LLM's training to understand more about the problem domain.\nThe previous article also discussed when to use each approach, pro's and con's of each approach and several other considerations.\nThis article explores RAG in more depth, specifically, all of the work required to create a production-ready solution.\nThe previous article depicted the steps or phases of RAG using the following diagram.", "- Acknowledge the non-deterministic nature of generative AI in your design, planning for variability in outputs and setting up mechanisms to ensure consistency and relevance in responses.\n- Assess the benefits of preprocessing user prompts against the potential increase in latency and costs. Simplifying or modifying prompts before submission might improve response quality but could add complexity and time to the response cycle.\n- Investigate strategies for parallelizing LLM requests to enhance performance. This approach might reduce latency but requires careful management to avoid increased complexity and potential cost implications.\nIf you want to start experimenting with building a generative AI solution immediately, we recommend taking a look at Get started with the chat using your own data sample for Python. There are versions of the tutorial also available in .NET, Java, and JavaScript.", "- Hierarchical Indexes - This approach involves creating multiple layers of indexes, where a top-level index (summary index) quickly narrows down the search space to a subset of potentially relevant chunks, and a second-level index (chunks index) provides more detailed pointers to the actual data. This method can significantly speed up the retrieval process as it reduces the number of entries to scan in the detailed index by filtering through the summary index first.\n- Specialized Indexes - Specialized indexes like graph-based or relational databases can be used depending on the nature of the data and the relationships between chunks. For instance:\n- Graph-based indexes are useful when the chunks have interconnected information or relationships that can enhance retrieval, such as citation networks or knowledge graphs.", "- Index Selection: Based on the analysis, the query router selects one or more from potentially several available indexes. Each index might be optimized for different types of data or queries\u2014for example, some might be more suited to factual queries, while others might excel in providing opinions or subjective content.\n- Query Dispatch: The query is then dispatched to the selected index.\n- Results Aggregation: Responses from the selected indexes are retrieved and possibly aggregated or further processed to form a comprehensive answer.\n- Answer Generation: The final step involves generating a coherent response based on the retrieved information, possibly integrating or synthesizing content from multiple sources.\nYour organization might use multiple retrieval engines or indexes for the following use cases:", "- Small2Big - When chunking at a granular level like a single sentence, will the content be organized in such a way that it's easy to find the neighboring sentences or containing paragraph? (See \"Chunking organization.\") Retrieving this additional information and supplying it to the LLM could provide it more context when answering the user's query.\nChunking organization\nIn a RAG system, the organization of data in the vector database is crucial for efficient retrieval of relevant information to augment the generation process. Here are the types of indexing and retrieval strategies developers might consider:", "- Relational databases can be effective if the chunks are structured in a tabular format where SQL queries could be used to filter and retrieve data based on specific attributes or relationships.\n- Hybrid Indexes - A hybrid approach combines multiple indexing strategies to apply the strengths of each. For example, developers might use a hierarchical index for initial filtering and a graph-based index to explore relationships between chunks dynamically during retrieval.\nAlignment optimization\nTo enhance the relevance and accuracy of the retrieved chunks, align them closely with the question or query types they're meant to answer. One strategy to accomplish this is to generate and insert a hypothetical question for each chunk that represents what question the chunk is best suited to answer. This helps in several ways:", "It's possible that your organization decides to divide its corpus of content into multiple vector stores or entire retrieval systems. In that case, developers can employ a query router, which is a mechanism that intelligently determines which indexes or retrieval engines to use based on the query provided. The primary function of a query router is to optimize the retrieval of information by selecting the most appropriate database or index that can provide the best answers to a specific query.\nThe query router typically functions at a point after the user formulates the query, but before sending to retrieval systems. Here's a simplified workflow:\n- Query Analysis: The LLM or another component analyzes the incoming query to understand its content, context, and the type of information likely needed.", "Evaluating the results of a nondeterministic system isn't as simple as, say, unit or integration tests that most developers are familiar with. There are several factors to consider:\n- Are users satisfied with the results they're getting?\n- Are users getting accurate responses to their questions?\n- How do we capture user feedback? Do we have any policies in place that limit what data we're able to collect about user data?\n- For diagnosis on unsatisfactory responses, do we have visibility into all of the work that went into answering the question? Do we keep a log of each stage in the inference pipeline of inputs and outputs so we can perform root cause analysis?\n- How can we make changes to the system without regression or degradation of the results?\nCapturing and acting on feedback from users", "The entire inference pipeline is running in real time. While there's no one right way for the pre- and post-processing step design, it's likely a combination of programming logic and other LLM calls. One of the most important considerations then is the trade-off between building the most accurate and compliant pipeline possible and the cost and latency required to make it happen.\nLet's identify specific strategies in each stage.\nQuery preprocessing steps\nQuery preprocessing occurs immediately after your user submits their query, as depicted in this diagram:\nThe goal of these steps is to make sure the user is asking questions within the scope of our system (and not trying to \"jailbreak\" the system to make it do something unintended) and prepare the user's query to increase the likelihood that it locates the best possible article chunks using the cosine similarity / \"nearest neighbor\" search.", "As mentioned earlier, developers may need to work with their organization's privacy team to design feedback capture mechanisms and telemetry, logging, etc. to enable forensics and root cause analysis on a given query session.\nThe next step is to develop an assessment pipeline. The need for an assessment pipeline arises from the complexity and time-intensive nature of analyzing verbatim feedback and the root causes of the responses provided by an AI system. This analysis is crucial as it involves investigating every response to understand how the AI query produced the results, checking the appropriateness of the content chunks used from documentation, and the strategies employed in dividing up these documents.\nFurthermore, it involves considering any extra pre- or post-processing steps that could enhance the results. This detailed examination often uncovers content gaps, particularly when no suitable documentation exists in response to a user's query.", "- Improved Matching: During retrieval, the system can compare the incoming query with these hypothetical questions to find the best match, improving the relevance of the chunks fetched.\n- Training Data for Machine Learning Models: These pairings of questions and chunks can serve as training data to improve the machine learning models underlying the RAG system, helping it learn which types of questions are best answered by which chunks.\n- Direct Query Handling: If a real user query closely matches a hypothetical question, the system can quickly retrieve and use the corresponding chunk, speeding up the response time.\nEach chunk's hypothetical question acts like a \"label\" that guides the retrieval algorithm, making it more focused and contextually aware. This is useful in scenarios where the chunks cover a wide range of information topics or types.\nUpdate strategies", "- Data Type Specialization: Some indexes might specialize in news articles, others in academic papers, and yet others in general web content or specific databases like those for medical or legal information.\n- Query Type Optimization: Certain indexes might be optimized for quick factual lookups (for example, dates, events), while others might be better for complex reasoning tasks or queries requiring deep domain knowledge.\n- Algorithmic Differences: Different retrieval algorithms might be used in different engines, such as vector-based similarity searches, traditional keyword-based searches, or more advanced semantic understanding models.\nImagine a RAG-based system used in a medical advisory context. The system has access to multiple indexes:\n- A medical research paper index optimized for detailed and technical explanations.\n- A clinical case study index that provides real-world examples of symptoms and treatments.", "Ingestion is primarily concerned with storing your organization's documents in such a way that they can be easily retrieved to answer a user's question. The challenge is ensuring that the portions of the documents that best match the user's query are located and utilized during inference. Matching is accomplished primarily through vectorized embeddings and a cosine similarity search. However, it's facilitated by understanding the nature of the content (patterns, form, etc.) and the data organization strategy (the structure of the data when stored in the vector database).\nTo that end, developers need to consider the following steps:\n- Content preprocessing and extraction\n- Chunking strategy\n- Chunking organization\n- Update strategy\nContent preprocessing and extraction"], "title": "Building advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems", "meta": {"query": "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) integration of pretrained models advanced retrieval techniques minimizing hallucinations"}, "citation_uuid": -1}, "https://www.digital-alpha.com/reducing-llm-hallucinations-using-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag/": {"url": "https://www.digital-alpha.com/reducing-llm-hallucinations-using-retrieval-augmented-generation-rag/", "description": "RAG: A Promising Solution to LLM Hallucination.

By refining the models\u2019 training with targeted data, the risk of hallucination can be reduced.\n- Decoding strategies: Modifying the decoding algorithms used by LLMs can also help mitigate hallucination. Techniques such as top-p truncation and diverse beam search can introduce more diversity and reduce the likelihood of generating hallucinated content.", "Drawbacks of LLM Hallucination\nHallucinations in LLMs can have serious consequences, particularly in applications where accuracy and reliability are paramount. For instance, in the healthcare domain, hallucinated outputs from language models could lead to incorrect diagnoses or treatment recommendations, potentially putting lives at risk. Similarly, in the financial sector, hallucinations could result in erroneous investment advice or financial analyses, leading to significant monetary losses.\n- Misinformation and Fake News: Hallucinations can lead to the spread of misinformation and fake news. Inaccurate or made-up facts generated by LLMs can be presented as truth, especially when the models are perceived to be authoritative or knowledgeable. This can have serious societal implications, impacting trust in institutions, influencing public opinion, and even endangering lives.", "- Safety and Ethical Concerns: In sensitive applications, hallucination can pose safety and ethical risks. For example, in healthcare, incorrect medical advice or misinterpretation of symptoms could lead to harmful treatment decisions. In legal or financial domains, inaccurate information could result in costly mistakes or unfair practices.\n- Damage to Brand Reputation: For companies deploying LLMs in their products or services, hallucination can lead to embarrassing and costly mistakes. Incorrect or inappropriate responses generated by these models can damage brand reputation and lead to a loss of customer trust and confidence.\n- Limited Real-world Applicability: Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs with high hallucination rates are limited in their real-world applicability. This is particularly true in enterprise settings where accuracy and reliability are non-negotiable.\nStrategies to Reduce LLM Hallucination", "RAG can help reduce LLM hallucination in several ways. First, by retrieving relevant documents before generating a response, RAG ensures that the model has access to accurate and up-to-date information. This can help reduce the likelihood of the model generating factually incorrect or outdated information. Second, RAG can help ensure that the model\u2019s responses are faithful to the input prompt. By using the input prompt to retrieve relevant documents, RAG ensures that the model\u2019s responses are grounded in the user\u2019s question or request. This can help reduce the likelihood of the model generating responses that are unrelated or only loosely related to the input. Finally, RAG can help improve the transparency and interpretability of LLMs. By providing users with a list of the documents that were retrieved and used to generate the response through the reranking approach, RAG allows users to see how the model arrived at its answer", "- Architectural modifications: Some researchers have proposed changes to the underlying architecture of LLMs to address hallucination. For example, incorporating memory modules or reasoning components can help LLMs better handle algorithmic tasks and reduce hallucination.\n- Prompt engineering: Carefully crafting the input prompts provided to LLMs can influence the quality and factual accuracy of the generated text. By including relevant context, instructions, and constraints, prompt engineering can help guide the LLM towards more reliable outputs.\n- Hallucination detection: Developing methods to automatically detect hallucinated content can help users identify and discard unreliable outputs. This can involve techniques such as anomaly detection, consistency checking, or using separate models trained to identify hallucinations.\nAmong these strategies, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) stands out as an innovative approach to reduce hallucinations effectively.", "Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP), providing impressive capabilities in tasks such as translation, summarization, and conversational AI.

Researchers prioritize high-quality, diverse, and factual information. Techniques like data cleansing and bias filtering ensure that LLMs are trained on more reliable sources.\n-\nFine-tuning with fact-checking\nFact-checking mechanisms act as a critical second layer to fine-tuning. As AI generates text, these mechanisms compare it against real-world knowledge bases like scientific publications or verified news articles. Inconsistencies get flagged, prompting the LLM to refine its output based on more factual grounding.\n-\nTeaching better reasoning", "As explained, RAG is not a silver bullet and cannot completely eliminate AI hallucinations. Retrieval-augmented generation is limited by its:\n-\nData quality\nRAG relies on the quality and accuracy of the internal knowledge bases it searches. Biases or errors in these sources can still influence the LLM's response.\n-\nContextual awareness\nWhile RAG provides factual LLM grounding, it might not fully grasp the nuances of the prompt or user intent. This can lead to the LLM incorporating irrelevant information or missing key points.\n-\nInternal reasoning and creativity\nRAG focuses on factual grounding but doesn't directly address the GenAI's internal reasoning processes.

The problem is it doesn\u2019t always tell the truth. The reason? An LLM relies solely on the static information it\u2019s trained on \u2013 and retraining it is time-consuming and expensive. Because its training data is based on stale, static, and publicly available information, an LLM may provide out-of-date, false, or generic responses as opposed to timely, true, and focused answers.\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is Generative AI (GenAI) framework designed to infuse an LLM with trusted data, fresh from a company\u2019s own sources, to have it generate more accurate and relevant responses.", "GenAI Data Fusion for Hallucination-Free RAG\nOne of the most effective ways to combat GenAI and RAG hallucinations is by using the most advanced RAG tool, one that retrieves/augments both structured AND unstructured data from a company\u2019s own private data sources.\nThis approach, called GenAI Data Fusion, accesses the structured data of a single business entity \u2013 customer, vendor, or order \u2013 from enterprise systems based on the concept of data products.\nA data-as-a-product approach enables GenAI data fusion to access dynamic data from multiple enterprise systems, not just static documents from knowledge bases.

Create a testing framework\nTesting a RAG system consists of running a set of queries against the tool and evaluating the output. A key prerequisite for rapid testing and iteration is to decide on a set of metrics as the definition of success, and calculate them in a rigorous, automated, and repeatable fashion.

Root cause analysis and iterative testing\nThe goal of setting up a repeatable testing framework is ideally understanding the root cause of issues. RAG is fundamentally based on two components: (1) the retrieval accuracy of your nearest neighbor matches and (2) the context that you provide to the LLM that generates your responses.\nIdentifying and isolating these components individually allows you to determine the specific areas that may be causing problems and formulating testable hypotheses that can be performed as experiments and run in Vertex AI using the Gen AI evaluation framework.", "Typically when performing a root cause analysis exercise, the user will execute a testing run as a baseline, modify the implementation of one of the RAG components, and re-execute the testing run. The delta between the output scores of the testing metrics is the influence of the RAG component that was altered. The goal in this phase is to modify and document the components carefully, aiming to optimize towards a maximum score for each of the chosen metrics. Often the temptation is to make multiple modifications between testing runs which can mask the impact of a specific process and whether it was successful in creating a measurable change in your RAG system.\nExamples of RAG experiments to run\nExample RAG components to experiment with:\n-\nWhat is the ideal number of neighbors for a document chunk that gets passed into an LLM to improve answer generation?\n-\nHow does embedding model choice affect retrieval accuracy?\n-", "Although some metrics can be calculated without a reference dataset, having a set of known-good outputs allows us to produce a more comprehensive and nuanced range of evaluation metrics.\n-\nOnly change one variable at a time between test runs\n-\nThere are many features of a RAG pipeline that can make a difference \u2013 by changing them one at a time, we can be sure that a change in evaluation scores is attributable to a single feature alone.\n-\nSimilarly, we must ensure that between test runs we do not change the evaluation questions being used, the reference answers, or any system-wide parameters and settings.\nThe basic process here is to change one aspect of the RAG system, run the battery of tests, adapt the feature, run the exact same battery of tests again and then see how the test results have changed.

Retrieval regularization can also be applied to ensure that the retriever doesn\u2019t overfit to specific query-document pairs, improving generalization to unseen data.\nApplications and Use Cases\n1. Question Answering (QA)\nRAG has been highly successful in QA systems, where it retrieves relevant documents to answer user queries. Its ability to ground answers in real data makes it ideal for factual QA tasks.\n2. Text Summarization\nBy retrieving relevant information from external sources, RAG can generate more comprehensive and contextually aware summaries, outperforming purely generative approaches.\n3.

These components work together to generate outputs based on both retrieved external documents and the input query.\nRetrieval Mechanism:\n- Given an input query, the RAG model first employs a retriever\u2014often a dense retriever like BERT or a vector search engine\u2014to pull the top-K relevant documents or pieces of information from a large external knowledge base or corpus (such as Wikipedia, enterprise databases, etc.).", "After the retrieval step, multiple candidate passages are often retrieved. RAG ranks these passages, prioritizing the ones that best match the query. Various scoring mechanisms can be used, including similarity scores between query and passage embeddings or additional scoring from external models.\nHandling Out-of-Domain or Ambiguous Queries\nFor out-of-domain queries or ambiguous inputs, RAG can struggle due to a lack of relevant data in the corpus. Techniques like fallback mechanisms (defaulting to a standard response when retrieval fails) or query disambiguation can help mitigate these challenges.\nTraining and Optimization\nPre-training and Fine-tuning Strategies", "RAG models are typically pre-trained on large corpora using self-supervised learning methods, similar to traditional transformers. However, they can be fine-tuned on domain-specific tasks to improve their retrieval and generation capabilities. For example, in a question-answering system, fine-tuning would involve training the retriever to pull the most relevant documents from a knowledge base and training the generator to formulate precise answers.\nObjective Functions and Loss Calculations\nRAG models are optimized using a joint loss function that incorporates both retrieval and generation objectives. Common objectives include:\n- Cross-entropy loss for training the generative model.\n- Margin-based loss for optimizing retrieval, encouraging the retriever to pull documents that are more relevant to the query.\nTechniques for Mitigating Overfitting and Improving Generalization", "In this article, we\u2019ll dive deep into the underlying architecture of RAG, its benefits over traditional generative models, real-world applications, challenges, and how to implement it using popular AI frameworks like Huggingface Transformers.\nDefinition and Overview of RAG\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a cutting-edge architecture in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that fuses two paradigms: retrieval-based and generative models.
