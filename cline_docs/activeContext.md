# Active Context

## Current Activity
- Implementing RAG integration for enhanced retrieval
  - Designed RAGRetriever class implementing Retriever interface
  - Implemented hybrid search combining dense and sparse vectors
  - Added session-based API calls for efficiency
  - Configured RAG API through secrets.toml
- Integrating RAG with existing knowledge curation pipeline
  - Maintaining backward compatibility with current search modules
  - Handling RAG API rate limits with exponential backoff
  - Optimizing retrieval performance through parameter tuning

## Recent Changes
- Added RAG API configuration to secrets.toml
- Implemented hybrid search functionality
- Documented RAG integration patterns
- Updated system documentation with RAG details
- Successfully launched Co-STORM interactive session
- Documented Co-STORM conversation workflow

## How Co-STORM Works
1. Initial Setup:
   - User provides a topic of interest
   - System performs warm start to gather background information
   - AI moderator initiates discussion

2. Interactive Conversation:
   - Moderator guides discussion with questions and insights
   - When prompted for "Your utterance", user can:
     * Ask questions about the topic
     * Share personal knowledge
     * Guide discussion direction
     * Respond to moderator's questions

3. Output Generation:
   - System collects and organizes information
   - Generates comprehensive report
   - Saves conversation history

## Next Steps
1. Follow RAG implementation plan (see RAG_Implementation_Plan.md)
2. Document common usage patterns
3. Create example conversation scenarios
4. Add troubleshooting section
5. Expand configuration documentation

## Current Focus
- Understanding Co-STORM's interactive capabilities
- Guiding users through conversation workflow
- Improving documentation for better user experience
