# Product Context

## Project Name
STORM (Synthesis of Topic Outlines through Retrieval and Multi-perspective Question Asking)

## Purpose
STORM is a system that generates Wikipedia-like articles from scratch using large language models and internet search. It aims to assist in the pre-writing stage of article creation by:
1. Conducting internet-based research to collect references
2. Generating an outline
3. Producing a full-length article with citations

## Key Features
- Perspective-guided question asking
- Simulated conversation between writer and topic expert
- Modular architecture for customization
- Support for multiple language models and search engines

## Collaborative Version (Co-STORM)
Co-STORM enhances STORM by enabling human-AI collaboration through:
1. Interactive Discussion:
   - You choose a topic (e.g., "The Origins of Country Music")
   - AI experts gather information and start a discussion
   - You participate by sharing insights or asking questions
   - System responds intelligently to your input

2. Real-World Example:
   When discussing country music's evolution, you mentioned Beyonc√©'s country album, and the system:
   - Acknowledged this current trend
   - Connected it to broader genre-crossing patterns
   - Engaged you with follow-up questions
   - Used this information to enrich the discussion

3. Knowledge Building:
   - Creates a dynamic mind map of the topic
   - Integrates your contributions with AI research
   - Generates a comprehensive final report
   - Maintains citations and references

4. Benefits:
   - Combines human expertise with AI research capabilities
   - Creates more engaging and relevant content
   - Adapts to your interests and knowledge
   - Produces well-documented, cited articles

The goal is to make research and article creation an interactive, collaborative process where your insights help shape the final output while maintaining academic rigor through citations and fact-checking.
